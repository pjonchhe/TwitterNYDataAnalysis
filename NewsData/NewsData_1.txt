Today  we end with a note from the departing writer of our European briefing  Patrick Boehler 
Since the European briefings  inception over a year ago  this has been the question I have been asked the most   How do you know what Europeans want to read  
That s a fair question for a journalist  albeit a European one  who has spent most of his adult life in Asia  and still is there 
It is also a legitimate question for a U S  newspaper at a time in which American news cycles are focused on the twists and turns of a tumultuous presidency 
So  here s what we do 
Every day  we spend hours poring over correspondents  dispatches and news reports from across Europe  from Iceland to Turkey 
In conversations with editors  we seek to distill wider trends from the day to day politics and give you what you need to know to start your day 
Of course  the result has often been a compromise  Is it flawed  Always 
But that s the rule for all early drafts of history 
My last briefing is today s  I d like to invite you to keep reading  keep debating and keep challenging assumptions  Thank you for your time  Now enjoy your morning coffee

As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation  an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive 
The impending exit of that executive   Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief information security officer   reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network  Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run up to the 2018 midterm elections  according to current and former employees briefed on the matter 
Mr  Stamos  who plans to leave Facebook by August  had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues  but was met with resistance by colleagues  said the current and former employees  In December  Mr  Stamos s day to day responsibilities were reassigned to others  they said 
Mr  Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad  the people said  He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook s product and infrastructure divisions  His group  which once had 120 people  now has three  the current and former employees said 
Mr  Stamos would be the first high ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site  Company leaders   including Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  and Sheryl Sandberg  the chief operating officer   have struggled to address a growing set of problems  including Russian interference on the platform  the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company 
The developments have taken a toll internally  said the seven people briefed on the matter  who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Some of the company s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook s image has taken a beating  Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies  such as Twitter  which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue  have not had to deal with as much criticism 
One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team  The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site  but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives  said the people briefed on the matter 
 The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company   said Sandy Parakilas  who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology  which is looking at the effect of technology on people 
Mr  Stamos said in statement on Monday   These are really challenging issues  and I ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues  including other executives   On Twitter  he said he was  still fully engaged with my work at Facebook  and acknowledged that his role has changed  without addressing his future plans 
Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr  Stamos s departure 
Mr  Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015  He and other Facebook executives  such as Ms  Sandberg  disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform  said the people briefed on the matter  In his statement  Mr  Stamos said his relationship with Ms  Sandberg was  productive  
Mr  Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016  the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers  the current and former employees said 
By November 2016  the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook  That same month  Mr  Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election  calling it a  pretty crazy idea  
In the ensuing months  Facebook s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site  according to the current and former employees  By the spring of 2017  deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company 
Mr  Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible  while others including Elliot Schrage  Facebook s vice president of communications and policy  recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence  said the current and former employees 
A detailed memorandum Mr  Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined  in hypothetical terms  how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary  they said  Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote  That footnote acknowledged that Facebook s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election  and Hillary Clinton in particular 
Mr  Stamos said in his statement that  we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U S  intelligence community  which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state sponsored actors  
But Facebook s decision to omit Russia backfired  Weeks later  a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform  allegations that Facebook initially denied 
By last September  after Mr  Stamos s investigation had revealed further Russian interference  Facebook was forced to reverse course  That month  the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015  Russians had paid Facebook  100 000 to run roughly 3 000 divisive ads to show the American electorate 
In response  lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia  the top Democrat on the intelligence committee  said that although Facebook s revelation was a good first step   I m disappointed it s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they ve become much more transparent  
And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network  Last October and November  Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform  along with executives from Twitter and YouTube 
The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more  said the current and former employees  Since the 2016 election  Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr  Zuckerberg and Ms  Sandberg  conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public  said Tavis McGinn  who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017 
Mr  McGinn  who now heads Honest Data  which has done polling about Facebook s reputation in different countries  said Facebook is  caught in a Catch 22  
 Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong   he said   But if they don t  it damages their image  
Mr  McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company s conduct 
By December 2017  Mr  Stamos  who reports to Facebook s general counsel  proposed that he report directly to higher ups  Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr  Stamos s team  splitting the security team between its product team  overseen by Guy Rosen  and infrastructure team  overseen by Pedro Canahuati  according to current and former employees 
Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco  Mr  Stamos has largely been left as Facebook s security communicator  Last month  he appeared as Facebook s representative at the Munich Security Conference 
Over the weekend  after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users  Facebook s communications team encouraged Mr  Stamos to tweet in defense of the company  but only after it asked to approve Mr  Stamos s tweets  according to two people briefed on the incident 
After the tweets set off a furious response  Mr  Stamos deleted them 
Roger B  McNamee  an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr  Zuckerberg  said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content 
 I told them   Your business is based on trust  and you re losing trust    said Mr  McNamee  a founder of the Center for Humane Technology   They were treating it as a P R  problem  when it s a business problem  I couldn t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track  
MUMBAI   In many countries  Facebook is contending with a darkening reputation as a vehicle for  disinformation and false news  The most recent example  Sri Lanka 
This week  the island country sought to block access to the social network  as well as two other platforms that Facebook owns  WhatsApp and Instagram  in an attempt to stem mob violence directed at its Muslim minority  Citing inflammatory posts on Facebook and WhatsApp  the Sri Lankan government ordered internet providers and mobile phone carriers on Wednesday to temporarily block the services along with Viber  another messaging app 
 These platforms are banned because they were spreading hate speeches and amplifying them   Harindra B  Dassanayake  a government spokesman  said in a phone interview on Thursday  Sri Lanka s government has also imposed a nationwide state of emergency after violence broke out Sunday in one of the island s central cities  where dozens of Muslim businesses  houses and at least one mosque were attacked  At least one person was killed 
Sri Lanka is the latest country to grapple with hate speech being magnified on Facebook  especially in parts of the world that have only recently come online  As use of the social media platform has ballooned in recent years  so have cases of extremist fringe groups using Facebook s reach to magnify their messages 
In Myanmar  where Facebook is so dominant that it is often confused for the internet itself  the social network has been blamed for allowing hate speech to spread  widening longstanding ethnic divisions and stoking violence against the Rohingya ethnic group  In the Philippines  Facebook has been used to spread pro government propaganda 
Internet watchdog groups have long warned that Facebook was being used to distribute hate speech about ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka  Freedom House  a Washington based nonprofit that advocates for free speech and democracy  said in a recent report that  hate speech against minorities continues to foment on various social media platforms  particularly Facebook   The report said online campaigns targeting Muslims and other minority groups in Sri Lanka had been ongoing since 2013 and had recently increased 
Sri Lankan officials this week blamed Sri Lanka s Buddhist majority  as well as Muslims  for spreading false information on the social networks 
 Some attacks that have actually not taken place are being reported  It spreads that we are being attacked and we have to respond   said Mr  Dassanayake  In some cases  people were also sharing information on how to make simple bombs  he said 
On Thursday  the violence continued  according to news reports  Although Facebook was blocked  WhatsApp was functioning sporadically 
On Twitter  two of the country s legendary cricket players  Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena  tried to defuse tensions 
 I strongly condemn the recent acts of violence   everyone involved must be brought to justice regardless of race  religion or ethnicity   Mr  Jayawardena tweeted on Wednesday 
Sri Lanka is still recovering from a long civil war waged by Tamil separatists  The conflict ended in 2009 after the military crushed the rebels  and hard feelings remain 
Facebook said Thursday that it has clear rules against hate speech and incitement to violence   We are responding to the situation in Sri Lanka and are in contact with the government and nongovernmental organizations to support efforts to identify and remove such content   the company said in a statement 
Mr  Dassanayake confirmed that Facebook was cooperating with the Sri Lankan government  He said that at a meeting in Colombo  the capital  on Thursday morning  the government raised more than 100 items with the company 
 Once we come to an agreement on these  and once the situation is under control  Facebook will be live again   he said  It was not immediately clear what the items entailed 
Sri Lanka is hardly the only country to resort to extreme measures like a social media shutdown 
Last year  India blocked 22 social networking services   including Facebook  Twitter  WhatsApp and YouTube   for one month in the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir in a bid to curb street protests there  Mobile internet service is also frequently blocked in Kashmir  which borders Pakistan and has gone through spasms of violence for decades 
Turkey has also repeatedly shut down Twitter and YouTube for allowing content opposed by the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan  the country s president 
SPECIAL POST   People from all walks of life sit down every day  Maybe some of you stand  Who am I to judge   and solve puzzles to help satisfy that need to put the world in order and test their gray matter 
One not so well kept secret on the puzzle making side of the business is that your favorite puzzle makers may have learned their trade from a more experienced constructor  Full disclosure  I owe my career to Nancy Salomon  who was incredibly patient with me as I learned the ropes   Mentors are published constructors who give generously of their time and teach new constructors how to polish a theme  what good fill looks like and how to write clues  They are continually giving back to the puzzle community  We stand on their shoulders 
Now  two puzzle makers  along with a group of constructors who are generously volunteering their time  would like to help diversify the pool of constructors who contribute to newspapers and magazines  Will Nediger  a 28 year old professional puzzle maker from London  Ontario  and Erik Agard  a constructor from Gaithersburg  Maryland who makes puzzle for a variety of venues including the Indie 500 Crossword Tournament  have teamed up to encourage more women and people of color to learn the art of crossword puzzle construction 
Mr  Nediger and Mr  Agard have created a public group on Facebook called the  Puzzle Collaboration Directory   an online resource that will match aspiring puzzle makers with experienced constructors to help them learn the craft  While anyone is welcome to join and find a published constructor  the focus is on diversifying the rotation normally seen in newspaper and magazine puzzles 
If a potential constructor has  patience  tenacity and  an aptitude for  lateral thinking   they have what they need to become a good puzzle maker  says Mr  Nediger  And  Mr  Agard chimes in   a love for solving puzzles  That s all constructing is  in my opinion  a slightly different puzzle and with room for individuality  
Aspiring puzzlemakers who are not on Facebook can still access the mentors  This is a growing list  but contact any of the constructors here to get started 
LONDON   During his long career  Howard L  Morgan has been an early executive at Renaissance Technologies  the giant hedge fund  and a co founder of First Round Capital  the venture capital firm 
His next role  joining the venture capital fund co led by Eduardo Saverin  one of the co founders of Facebook 
Mr  Saverin s venture capital firm  B Capital Group  announced on Monday that it had hired Mr  Morgan as its chairman 
It also announced other personnel moves  including the naming of Joe Davis  the chairman of the Boston Consulting Group s North American operations  as vice chairman  the hiring of Allen Duan as an operating partner  and the hiring of Rohit Bhagat as a senior adviser 
The addition of Mr  Morgan and the other executives is meant to bolster B Capital  which looks to invest in start ups around the world  The firm was created two years ago by Mr  Saverin  who is now based in Singapore  and Raj Ganguly  who is based on the West Coast  It also has a strategic partnership with the Boston Consulting Group  which can both help find potential investments and recommend the firm to start ups in search of capital 
 Howard  at the end of the day  is a giant in the industry   Mr  Saverin said in a telephone interview   You can gain a tremendous amount of perspective just from speaking with him for a couple of minutes  
Mr  Morgan  71  turned from academia to investing in the early 1980s  when he headed venture investments for the then nascent Renaissance Technologies hedge fund for nearly a decade  He later helped found Idealab  a foundry for start ups 
In 2004  he co founded First Round Capital  the seed stage investment firm that was an early investor in Uber  with Josh Kopelman and other partners  And he has served as a guide to other young investors  including those at B Capital 
 The reason we re so excited to have Howard on the team is that he s been an adviser and mentor to us since our inception   Mr  Ganguly said 
Mr  Morgan began stepping back from his duties at First Round Capital about five years ago  But Mr  Saverin and Mr  Ganguly told him earlier this year that they wanted to bring him on board to help build and develop B Capital 
 What Eduardo and Raj wanted from me was help and experience really building a culture   Mr  Morgan said   How do you make a physically distributed organization really feel like one company  
Mr  Morgan then conducted more due diligence on the firm  including by spending time with Rich Lesser  the chief executive of the Boston Consulting Group 
Ultimately  Mr  Morgan said  the opportunity to help another budding venture firm grow proved too attractive to pass up 
One primary focus for B Capital will remain finding investments outside of Silicon Valley and China  including in Southeast Asia 
 Asia is simply a massive market with opportunities that abound   Mr  Saverin said  pointing to the region s embrace of mobile technologies   It s just an incredibly exciting economy to invest in

SYDNEY    Australia s Privacy Commissioner said on Thursday she had opened a formal investigation into social media giant Facebook Inc after the company confirmed data from 300 000 Australian users may have been used without authorisation 
The investigation will consider whether Facebook has breached Australia s privacy laws  Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk said in a statement 
Facebook said on Wednesday that the personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million

SYDNEY    Australia on Thursday said it had begun an investigation to decide whether social media giant Facebook Inc breached its privacy laws  after the company confirmed data from 300 000 Australian users may have been used without authorization 
Personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  Facebook said on Wednesday  exceeding a media estimate of more than 50 million 
In a statement  Australia s privacy commissioner  Angelene Falk  said her office would  confer with regulatory authorities internationally   given the global nature of the matter 
A Facebook spokeswoman in Australia said the company would be  fully responsive  to the investigation and had recently updated some privacy settings 
Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  told reporters during a conference call that he accepted blame for the data leak 
Zuckerberg is due to testify about the matter next week during two U S  congressional hearings  and the data breach has drawn criticism from lawmakers and regulators around the world 
London based Cambridge Analytica  which has counted U S  President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign among its clients  disputed Facebook s estimate of affected users 
It said in a tweet on Wednesday that it received no more than 30 million records from a researcher it hired to collect data about people on Facebook 
Australia s investigation follows comments by New Zealand s privacy commissioner last week that Facebook had broken laws in that country  a charge the company called disappointing 
Australia s competition regulator is already investigating whether Facebook and Alphabet Inc s Google had disrupted the news media to the detriment of publishers and consumers

When Francesca Donner  director of The New York Times Gender Initiative  arrived in Australia a few weeks ago  she was almost immediately swept up in the wave of  MeToo and news media activities 
In addition to public panels on the  MeToo movement  there were conferences  university discussions and a dinner with young female New York Times readers to talk about our coverage 
Everyone  it seemed  had something to say about  MeToo 
On her way back to New York  Francesca jotted down a few impressions about Australia s gender movement and how it compares with what s happening in the United States 
Her thoughts raised as many questions as they answered  and we hope you ll share your insights as we unpack the issue 
Notebook from Sydney
Because I m director of the New York Times Gender Initiative  many people I met on my travels wanted to talk me about women and Trump and women and sexual harassment and women and Harvey and women and the workplace and women and women and women 
But they also had a few things to share  too 
The rumblings from women and people in their 20s and 30s began almost at once 
 Australian politics is a boys  club  The journalists here don t cover politicians as aggressively as they do in the U S  Exhibit A  and B and C and D   Barnaby Joyce  
 And the press  The press  There are so few publications we identify with  Most young people just turn away and shrug

Here s a New York Times review to give us all a hand 
A parade of regulators  politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook s privacy practices on Monday  as the fallout from the company s relationship with a political data firm continued to spread 
Early in the day  the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users 
Soon after  Senator Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to testify about privacy standards next month  He also extended invitations to Google s chief executive  Sundar Pichai  and Twitter s chief executive  Jack Dorsey 
And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr  Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook s privacy safeguards 
But one group of people interested in Facebook   investors   had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat  Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F T C  confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0 4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week 
The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica  which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign  gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users 
The F T C  said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signed in 2011 to protect users  privacy 
The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings  Each violation of the agreement  which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third party apps  carries a penalty of up to  40 000 a day 
The agency s acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook s stock down as much as 6 5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered  Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency 
The F T C  said in a statement on Monday that it  takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  
Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill  Last week  the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify 
 I m sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica  and I m sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there   Senator John Kennedy  Republican from Louisiana  said in an interview   Facebook isn t just a company  It is so powerful it is like a country  
Some lawmakers  such as Senator Richard Blumenthal  Democrat from Connecticut  asked the F T C  to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users 
 The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree   he said in a statement   There is no excuse for delay  
Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism  too  On Monday  Common Cause  a government watchdog group in Washington  filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law 
In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users  The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections  despite a warning from its own election lawyer 
The employees worked on polling  message development  and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals 
The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had  strategic  or  operational  roles  But former employees contradicted that account  suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non Americans can do for American political campaigns 
Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department  which has authority to investigate  knowing and willful  violations of campaign law  The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission  which has day to day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules 
 It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election related activities in U S  elections that they did so anyway   said Paul S  Ryan  Common Cause s vice president for policy and litigation 
In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company s privacy and user data policies  One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act  Wiretap Act  and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform 
The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users  browsing of third party health sites  Any site with a Facebook  like  button  including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology  could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook  according to the lawsuit 
Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica s use of Facebook user information 
Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook s stewardship of their personal data  The  deletefacebook campaign  as it has been called  has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp  one of Facebook s most popular services  who sold his company to the social media giant for  19 billion in 2014  Elon Musk  the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday 
While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States  pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years 
The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  And Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them 
JAKARTA  Indonesia    Indonesian government said Friday it is investigating Facebook over the privacy breach of its Indonesian users 
The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology said in a statement that it had asked the National Police chief to investigate possible violations of Indonesia s privacy law a day after Facebook announced that personal data of more than 1 million Indonesians might have been exposed by political consultant Cambridge Analytica 
It said Facebook representatives in Indonesia could face up to 12 years in prison and a fine of  871 000  if convicted 
The ministry summoned the representatives late Thursday to deliver a warning letter 
Communications Minister Rudiantara told reporters after the meeting that he has asked Facebook to stop its applications that could allow third parties to get users  personal information 
 We ask Facebook to provide us their audit results to see how the personal information is used by the Cambridge Analytica   said Rudiantara  who like many Indonesians uses a single name 
Facebook Indonesia Head of Public Policy Ruben Hattari said they will keep cooperating with the Indonesian government 
 Our main goal is to secure privacy data of all Facebook users   Hattari said after the meeting 
Indonesia is the world s fourth largest Facebook user with more than 115 million active members  and nearly 97 percent of them are on mobile devices 
In the fall of 2010  the Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner took the stage for a Q  and A  at a technology conference in San Francisco  Mr  Milner  whose holdings have included major stakes in Facebook and Twitter  is known for expounding on everything from the future of social media to the frontiers of space travel  But when someone asked a question that had swirled around his Silicon Valley ascent   Who were his investors    he did not answer  turning repeatedly to the moderator with a look of incomprehension 
Now  leaked documents examined by The New York Times offer a partial answer  Behind Mr  Milner s investments in Facebook and Twitter were hundreds of millions of dollars from the Kremlin 
Obscured by a maze of offshore shell companies  the Twitter investment was backed by VTB  a Russian state controlled bank often used for politically strategic deals 
And a big investor in Mr  Milner s Facebook deal received financing from Gazprom Investholding  another government controlled financial institution  according to the documents  They include a cache of records from the Bermuda law firm Appleby that were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and reviewed by The Times in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists 
Ultimately  Mr  Milner s companies came to own more than 8 percent of Facebook and 5 percent of Twitter  helping earn him a place on various lists of the world s most powerful business people  His companies sold those holdings several years ago  but he retains investments in several other large technology companies and continues to make new deals  Among Mr  Milner s current investments is a real estate venture founded and partly owned by Jared Kushner  President Trump s son in law and White House adviser 
Facebook  Twitter and other social media sites have become a major focus of federal investigations into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election  Federal prosecutors and congressional investigators are examining how Russians linked to the Kremlin turned the sites into garden hoses of bogus news stories and divisive political ads  and whether they coordinated with the Trump campaign 
No one has suggested that Mr  Milner or his companies had any connection to the propaganda operation  For his part  Mr  Milner said in a pair of recent interviews that the Russian government money was no different from the financing he had received from his many other investors around the world 
Even so  his use of the state directed apparatus employed by so many Russian oligarchs to enrich themselves shows how the Kremlin has extended its long financial arm not only to his company but to some of America s technology giants 
 Kremlin connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind   not just commercial interests but state interests as well   said Michael Carpenter  the Russia director at the National Security Council during the Obama administration  who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement   They go hand in hand  
Mr  Carpenter added   Oligarchs who receive significant amounts of financial support from Russian banks like VTB or Sberbank or Gazprombank have to pass above a political threshold  meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia s crony capitalist system  
There is nothing illegal about foreign state owned institutions investing in American companies  VTB and Gazprom said the transactions were both sound investments  not motivated by political considerations 
As Mr  Milner sees it  the story is similarly simple    nothing more than business   he said  adding   We are getting money  and we are putting them in Facebook and Twitter  We are making money for our limited partners  and we are giving money back to them  For me  it s a commercial arrangement  
 A statement from DST Global  Mr  Milner s venture capital firm  appears here  
Mr  Milner  55  studied theoretical physics at Moscow State University before moving to the United States  where he attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and then worked for the World Bank in Washington 
He returned to Russia and in the late 1990s and worked as an executive at Bank Menatep  which was founded by Mikhail B  Khodorkovsky  the oil tycoon who was stripped of his company  prosecuted and imprisoned after a televised confrontation with President Vladimir V  Putin 
Mr  Milner eventually teamed with Alisher Usmanov   an Uzbek Russian oligarch close to the Russian prime minister  Dmitri A  Medvedev   and a former Goldman Sachs executive to build a large stake in Mail ru  a Russian internet company that now trades on the London Stock Exchange 
Mr  Milner s initial American investments came as he served on an innovation commission set up in 2009 by Mr  Medvedev  who was Russia s president at the time and is something of a tech enthusiast  famously touring Apple s headquarters in Cupertino  Calif   with Steve Jobs 
In May 2009  Facebook announced an investment of roughly  200 million by Mr  Milner s company  Digital Sky Technologies  and said the company planned to spend at least  100 million buying additional stock  Eventually  Mr  Milner s new venture capital firm  DST Global  also amassed a significant stake in Facebook 
 A number of firms approached us  but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring   Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  said at the time 
The documents reviewed by The Times reveal that DST brought something else as well  a connection   through a succession of shell companies   to the Kremlin 
In those years  as part of its diplomatic  reset  with Moscow  the Obama administration was encouraging Russia to learn from the American technology industry  Importing tech knowledge  the theory went  would ease Russia s dependence on exporting oil and gas 
For the Facebook deal  it was Gazprom  the state controlled natural gas giant  that became the bridge  The company  a vital component of the Putin government  has employed its financial subsidiary  Gazprom Investholding  to reclaim assets privatized during the 1990s 
Gazprom Investholding is  used for politically important and strategically important deals for the Kremlin   said Ilya Zaslavskiy  a contributor to the Kleptocracy Initiative  a project of the Hudson Institute  a conservative think tank in Washington  Both VTB and Gazprom Investholding s parent  Gazprom  are under United States sanctions stemming from Russia s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 
Over several years  Gazprom Investholding and a subsidiary made hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to a company called Kanton Services  according to records from the Panama Papers  the trove of leaked documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca  Kanton  in turn  owned one of the DST investment vehicles used to buy shares of Facebook  While it is unclear precisely when Kanton first received its stake in the DST entity  Kanton received  197 million of the Gazprom Investholding loans three months before Facebook announced its first deal with Mr  Milner  the records show 
Kanton  based in the British Virgin Islands  had numerous ties to Mr  Milner s backer  Mr  Usmanov 
Kanton was owned by a longtime Usmanov business associate  and was controlled by Matthias Bolliger  a director of numerous subsidiaries of Mr  Usmanov s main holding company  USM Holdings  according to an Appleby memo and the Panama Papers  And an email sent by a trust company on the Isle of Man used by Mr  Usmanov referred to Kanton as a  private investment company   facebook and twitter   
In the interviews  Mr  Milner said his investors  identities were not generally public information  And he sought to distance his company from Mr  Usmanov   I had no knowledge of him using state funds to invest with us   he said  What s more  he said  Mr  Usmanov had many potential sources of financing  making it impossible to know whether money from Gazprom Investholding was even used to finance his stake in Facebook 
To demonstrate this  Mr  Milner set out a series of clear plastic cups with labels like  Alleged Russian government funds    Mr  Usmanov  and  Facebook   He pulled out a large bag of green M M s  filled several cups and proceeded to shift the M M s from one cup to another   Money is fungible   he explained  adding   You can t just say that this specific dollar went all the way to Facebook  
A spokesman for Mr  Usmanov  Rollo Head  did not address specific questions  But in a statement  he insisted that there are clear streams of money that do not mingle  Mr  Usmanov  he said   did not borrow from or use state or quasi state funds to make investments in Facebook  
The Facebook deal was a case study in the way Russia s oligarchs have mixed public and private roles for their own  and their government s  benefit  Even as he was investing in Facebook  Mr  Usmanov was general director of Gazprom Investholding 
In fact  Mr  Usmanov had often intertwined his government position with his personal deals  according to a report by the global investigations and security firm Kroll  Kroll described those arrangements as  synergies  
The Kroll report   a  reputation audit    had been commissioned by Mr  Usmanov as he set out to burnish his image a year before his deal with Mr  Milner to invest in Facebook  Kroll investigators  relying on public records and interviews  detailed a long and colorful history  time in prison in Uzbekistan  he was later exonerated  and past associations with alleged Russian organized crime figures  according to a draft copy of the report reviewed by The Times 
The investigators also recounted a dizzying number of deals   involving mining  media and technology companies  often with the assistance of the Kremlin and Mr  Medvedev   Usmanov looks set to end the Putin era as the  most improved  oligarch over the past eight years   one source told Kroll 
Kroll investigators found that  for some investments  Mr  Usmanov turned to Kanton  the company that would be a part of Mr  Milner s Facebook investment 
A Facebook spokeswoman  Vanessa Chan  declined to answer specific questions about the deal with DST  calling it a  passive investor  and noting that the company had invested and cashed out several years ago 
Gazprom Investholding called the loans  prudent   saying they were  provided for general corporate purposes  at above market rates  The company did not answer a question about what role  if any  Mr  Usmanov played in the loans  except to say that as its general director  he  operated in accordance  with the company s charter 
To complete the Facebook deal  DST used a pair of lawyers based in Cyprus and Britain who have also set up offshore entities for Russian oligarchs close to Mr  Putin  according to the Panama Papers  United States securities filings and records from Appleby  DST did not answer questions about how it came to use the two lawyers 
After the Facebook deal  Mr  Milner became a fixture in Silicon Valley  spending about  100 million on a 25 000 square foot house in Los Altos Hills and investing  7 billion in more than 30 companies  including Spotify  Airbnb and Groupon 
In interviews  he has referred to his close relationship to management at the companies in which he invests  Mr  Milner and Mr  Zuckerberg became friends and met monthly  Still  despite his company s sizable stake  Mr  Milner did not take a board seat or voting rights 
At the 2010 technology conference in San Francisco  Mr  Milner was asked if he provided management with advice along with his cash   I think it s actually the opposite   he replied   I sometimes get informal advice from them  
Mr  Milner s roughly  380 million investment in Twitter was directly backed by another instrument of Kremlin power  Russia s second largest bank  VTB 
Sixty one percent of the bank is owned by the Russian government  VTB s president  Andrey L  Kostin  is a former Soviet diplomat  Matthias Warnig  on the bank s supervisory council  is a former East German spy who served in Dresden while Mr  Putin was stationed there with the K G B 
VTB has operations across the world  including in the United States  In recent years  it has been involved in a number of politically sensitive deals  including a loan that financed the Russian government s murky privatization of 19 5 percent of the oil giant Rosneft 
Last year  the Panama Papers revealed that a Cyprus bank owned by VTB was used to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to accounts connected to Sergei Roldugin  a cellist and close friend of Mr  Putin  It was unknown what the money was for  but some speculated that he was working as a frontman for Kremlin insiders 
Mr  Roldugin did not respond to messages for this article  but said at the time that his wealth came through donations from rich businessmen for the purchase of musical instruments  VTB called the account in the Panama Papers  unsubstantiated  
 VTB is really a slush fund for Putin   said Anders Aslund  a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington  and an early economic adviser to the post Soviet Russian government  The bank  he added  is  the black cashier of the Putin crowd  
Mr  Milner s Twitter deal is a complex web of share transfers and offshore financial entities  But its details may offer clues that there was a strategic motive behind VTB s involvement 
In July 2011  VTB invested at least  191 million in exchange for shares of an Isle of Man company called DST Investments 3  corporate records show  That offshore vehicle was used to buy roughly half of DST Global s stake in Twitter that month  DST Investments 3 also issued shares to Kanton  the company linked to Mr  Usmanov that was at the center of the Facebook deal 
The Twitter deal had a notable feature  VTB put virtually all of the cash into DST Investments 3  filings show  Kanton contributed almost none  It is highly unusual for investors in DST funds to get stakes without contributing cash  according to a person familiar with the matter 
On May 7  2014   six months after Twitter s initial public offering  when insiders were first permitted to sell their shares   VTB transferred the bulk of its stake in DST Investments 3 to Kanton  DST also cashed out its Twitter investment 
DST had one other investment from VTB  which Mr  Milner compared to a sovereign wealth fund  VTB was an investor in the Chinese internet company JD com as recently as February 2015  when it transferred its stake to Kanton  Isle of Man records show 
In a statement  VTB said its involvement with Twitter was  solely a financial investment   sold for a profit  one of several successful deals in the high tech industry in that period  The bank added   VTB is a solely commercial bank  we have never had any politically motivated deals  
Twitter declined to answer a series of questions about VTB  but said that as a matter of policy it had done reviews of all pre I P O  investors 
Mr  Milner would not discuss how VTB came to be an investor  other than to say that the bank helped take Mail ru public in 2010  According to the Kroll report  the Kremlin had previously ordered VTB to finance other ventures of Mr  Usmanov  The report also details the close relationship between Mr  Usmanov and Mr  Medvedev  finding that Mr  Medvedev helped him win a bid for a lucrative copper ore deposit in Siberia 
Mr  Milner has also been active beyond Silicon Valley  He is a founder of the Breakthrough Prize  a series of lucrative scientific awards  And in July 2015  he was one of several high profile investors in Cadre  a New York based real estate technology company founded by Mr  Kushner and his brother  Joshua   Other investors and partners include Goldman Sachs  George Soros and Peter Thiel s Founders Fund  
Mr  Milner said he invested  850 000 in Cadre through a trust  which in turn controls DST Global Advisers  DST Global s investment management firm  He said he was introduced to the company through an early investor whose name he did not remember  He said he met Jared Kushner only once  at a conference in Aspen  Colo 
Mr  Kushner and Cadre declined to comment 
In his interviews with The Times  Mr  Milner shied away from the controversy now enveloping Facebook and Twitter  his former major investments 
Growing up in the Soviet Union  he said   if you re a father and you have a conversation with your son  it s easy to say   Please don t get involved in politics   
That  was my principle back then and still now   he said  adding   I prefer just to focus on business and philanthropy  And this is plenty for me

NEW YORK    Facebook s No  2 executive says the company should have conducted an audit after learning that a political consultancy improperly accessed user data nearly three years ago 
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told NBC s  Today  show that at the time  Facebook received legal assurances that Cambridge Analytica had deleted the improperly obtained information 
 What we didn t do is the next step of an audit and we re trying to that now   she said 
The audit of Cambridge Analytica is on hold  in deference to a U K  investigation  But Facebook has been conducting a broader review of its own practices and how other third party apps use data 
In addition  Facebook announced on Friday that it will require advertisers who want to run not just political ads  but also or so called  issue ads   which may not endorse specific candidates or parties but discuss political topics  to be verified 
Facebook is trying to strengthen its system ahead of this year s U S  midterm elections as well as upcoming elections around the world  Facebook has already required political ads to verify who is paying for them and where the advertiser is located  The issue ads requirement is new 
Facebook will also require the administrators of pages with a  large number  of followers to also be verified  The company did not say what this number would be  The move is intended to clamp down on fake pages and accounts that were used to disrupt the 2016 presidential elections in the U S 
Facebook says page administrators and advertisers will be verified by being asked to provide a government issued ID  To verify addresses  it will mail a postcard with a unique code that the recipient can then enter into Facebook  This is similar to how Airbnb and other services verify addresses 
The company is facing a global backlash over the improper data sharing scandal  Hearings over the issue are scheduled in the U S   and the European Union is considering what actions to take against the company 
Sandberg also told NBC that if users were able to opt out of being shown ads   at the highest level  that would be a paid product   This does not mean the company is planning to let users do this  Zuckerberg has made similar statements in the past  but has added that Facebook remains committed to offering a free service paid for by advertising 
Facebook users can opt out of seeing targeted ads  but can t shut off ads altogether  Neither can they opt entirely out of Facebook s data collection 
Sandberg gave several interviews this week as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before Congress next week  where the issue of elections meddling is almost certain to come up 
Facebook is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in what s become its worst privacy crisis in its 14 year history 
It started with revelations that Cambridge Analytica  a data mining firm  improperly accessed the private information of tens of millions of users to try to influence elections around the world  Over the past three weeks the scandal continued to spiral  For one  Facebook executives took nearly five days to respond to the Cambridge Analytica reports 
Then  some users who logged in to Facebook through Android devices discovered that Facebook had been collecting information about phone calls they made and text messages they sent  Facebook also acknowledged this week that nearly all of its 2 2 billion users may have had their public data scraped by  malicious actors  it did not name 
NEW YORK    The Latest on Facebook s privacy scandal  all times local  
2 30 p m 
Facebook has been secretly deleting some messages CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent through its Messenger application  an option that hasn t been available to most of the social network s 2 2 billion users 
The company says it has been removing Zuckerberg s messages from the inboxes of various people for several years  The recipients of Zuckerberg s messages weren t informed before that happened  Facebook is making the acknowledgement Friday after TechCrunch first reported the tactic 
Facebook says it began erasing the messages of Zuckerberg and a few other top executives in 2014 after computer hackers obtained and released emails from Sony Pictures executives  The Sony messages included disparaging remarks about movie stars and other people in the entertainment industry 
Although the ability to automatically delete sent texts hadn t been previously available  Facebook says it now plans to make it available to all users  The company apologized for not doing so sooner 
The development comes as Facebook faces questions about trust in light of one of its worst privacy scandals in its 14 year history

Mark Zuckerberg s defense comes after Apple CEO Tim Cook said his company wouldn t be in Facebook s situation because Apple doesn t sell ads based on customer data the way Facebook does  Zuckerberg responded Monday that an advertising supported business model is the only way that the service can survive because not everyone would be able to pay for Facebook if it charged a fee 
He says the idea that Facebook doesn t care about its customers is  extremely glib  
Facebook is facing scrutiny over its data collection following allegations that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained data on tens of millions of Facebook users to try to influence elections

SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook on Friday announced a series of moves meant to improve the transparency of political ads and pages on its social media service  The changes came just days before Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  is to testify before Congress 
Mr  Zuckerberg said in a post that the company has started requiring advertisers to verify their identity and location before they can run political ads on Facebook  That verification is meant to prevent foreign interference in elections  like the paid posts by so called Russian trolls ahead of the 2016 presidential election 
Mr  Zuckerberg added that he supported a proposed Senate bill  the Honest Ads Act  that would require such disclosures 
Facebook will also soon start verifying the identify and location of people who run large Facebook pages  Mr  Zuckerberg said  Officials say Russian agents used pages to pose as Americans on different sides of the political spectrum in an attempt to spread misinformation before the election 
 These steps by themselves won t stop all people trying to game the system  But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads   Mr  Zuckerberg said in his post 
After playing down problems with the site for months  Facebook has begun to make changes after revelations that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users 
The company recently removed 270 accounts associated with Russia s Internet Research Agency  the so called troll factory that spread misinformation amid the election  Sheryl Sandberg  the company s chief operating officer  gave several lengthy interviews to reporters this week 
Mr  Zuckerberg himself spent an hour taking questions from reporters this week and he agreed to testify before Congress next week 
NEW YORK    The author of a provocative Facebook memo declaring that growth is justified even if it costs lives says he doesn t actually agree with the memo and wrote it to provoke debate 
The 2016 internal memo  titled  The Ugly   was leaked to BuzzFeed this week  In it  Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said  all the work we do in growth is justified   even if it costs people their lives because they are exposed to bullies or die in a terrorist attack coordinated through Facebook 
Bosworth  who goes by  Boz   has been at Facebook since 2006 and serves as the company s vice president in charge of virtual  and augmented reality efforts  Previously  he was vice president of ads and helped create Facebook features such as Messenger  its news feed and groups 
Bosworth tweeted Thursday that the memo was one of the most unpopular things he s written internally  and  the ensuing debate helped shape our tools for the better  
In a statement to BuzzFeed that Facebook confirmed  CEO Mark Zuckerberg called Bosworth a  talented leader who says many provocative things   but added the memo was something  that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly  
 We ve never believed the ends justify the means   Zuckerberg said in the statement   We recognize that connecting people isn t enough by itself  We also need to work to bring people closer together  We changed our whole mission and company focus to reflect this last year  
Facebook is grappling with an unprecedented crisis over allegations that Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  obtained data of tens of millions of users without their permission with the intent of swaying elections  That followed a string of scandals  including revelations that Russia used its platform to meddle in U S  elections 
Facebook is facing new questions about its practice of collecting call and text histories from Android devices  The company has not provided details on why it needed this data or what it did with it  saying only that it was used to improve people s experience on Facebook  It s not clear how the data collection made Facebook users  experience better on Android devices when Facebook couldn t get the same data from iPhones 
VANCOUVER    The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Thursday that it  along with its counterpart in British Columbia  will jointly investigate Facebook Inc and Canadian data firm AggregateIQ  over an ongoing data sharing scandal

British Columbia s privacy commissioner was separately investigating AggregateIQ over whether the Victoria based company had broken provincial personal privacy rules for its role in the Brexit campaign 
The two agencies will now jointly investigate the companies  as they are subject to both federal and provincial personal privacy laws

BERLIN    German Justice Minister Katarina Barley said she planned a further meeting with Facebook to discuss the impact of its algorithms on the social network s users  adding that recent disclosures of privacy violations were probably not isolated 
Facebook said on Wednesday that the personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  more than previous estimates 
 I plan a further discussion with Facebook to discuss the question of algorithms  which  govern how people are categorized according to their usage of data   Barley told reporters on Thursday 
Data privacy is a sensitive subject in Germany  where memories of the two 20th century police states on its territory have spurred the government to take a leading role in pushing for tighter regulation of data driven Internet giants 
A poll for ARD public television found that 61 percent of Germany s internet users were concerned that their data had been misused  though only 12 percent said they had cut back on Facebook usage  A further 2 percent had stopped altogether 
The meeting with Barley will be the social network s second such summons from the German government since the New York Times and London s Observer newspaper broke news of the use of its data by Cambridge Analytica on March 16  Facebook shares have since lost 16 percent  wiping more than  80 billion from its market value 
 We should have no illusions  the Cambridge Analytica cases won t be the only ones and Facebook is probably not the only Internet giant where similar doubtful cases occurred   Barley said on Thursday   It s probably just the tip of the iceberg  
Earlier  the British Information Commissioner s Office  ICO  said Facebook was co operating with its examination into how 30 organizations have used personal data  but that it was too early to say whether the social media giant had done enough 
The ICO said it was looking at how data was collected from a third party app on Facebook and shared with Cambridge Analytica  as well as a broader investigation into how social media platforms have been used in political campaigning

THE UKRAINIAN NIGHT An Intimate History of Revolution By Marci Shore 290 pp  Yale University Press   26
On Nov  21  2013  Viktor Yanukovych  Ukraine s president  abruptly suspended long running negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union  Though Yanukovych personified the corruption  cronyism and oligarchical capitalism rampant in Ukraine  he had previously promoted the accord  which many Ukrainians  particularly in the country s center and west  anticipated as a pathway to a better life and communion with the West 
Within hours  thanks to Facebook and Twitter  protesters thronged Kiev s Independence Square  Maidan Nezalezhnosti   Once the riot police started beating demonstrators  and especially after the first fatalities  Yanukovych was doomed  By late February  he had fled  Moscow reacted by annexing the Crimea  Ukraine s sole Russian majority region  and supporting an armed insurgency in the Donbass  eastern Ukraine   which  compared with central and western Ukraine  has been shaped more by Russian culture and the Soviet past and contains many ethnic Russians  as well as Ukrainians whose primary language is Russian  The fighting has killed more than 10 000 people and placed a heavy economic burden on a country that can ill afford it 
Though the Maidan movement cleared the way for the election of the current Ukrainian government  led by the tycoon Petro Poroshenko  the reformers within it face fierce resistance from the beneficiaries of corruption and oligarchy  some of whom are in the cabinet  The reforms have stalled  eroding public faith in Ukraine s political institutions  The dreams that drove the uprising may yet be realized   or dashed  as happened after the 2004 Orange Revolution  whose failure enabled Yanukovych s election in 2010 
 The Ukrainian Night   the Yale historian Marci Shore s compact book  its large font chapters typically range from two to seven pages   seeks to portray the ideals that animated the protesters  Shore succeeds admirably  particularly because she tells the story through their words  Her sympathy for their courage and her support for a democratic Ukraine aligned with the West are evident  her depictions of the sights  sounds and smells on the Maidan superb  In lucid  if occasionally overwrought  prose she draws evocative portraits of people who braved the bitter cold   and truncheons and bullets   to create a  parallel polis  with barricades  soup kitchens  libraries  rock concerts  fiery speakers and solidarity among Ukrainians of disparate backgrounds 
This is not a work of historical scholarship  nor is it comparable to the detailed eyewitness reportage of writers like Keith Gessen or Sophie Pinkham  Shore strides through centuries of Ukraine s past  but the result verges on potted history  It offers little to readers familiar with Ukraine and not nearly enough for novices seeking to understand the stark cultural and political variations within the country or the complex forces that produced the Maidan revolution  Shore wishes to give the movement a human face  but she devotes so much space to people s appearances  professions  families  ruminations and inner thoughts that her account resembles a collage of personalities 
Shore does not dispute that Yanukovych was elected fairly in 2010 yet fails to explain how a crook and a thug   hoodlum  is her apt description   who betrayed even the inhabitants of the Donbass  his political bastion  prevailed  or why he suddenly shelved the association agreement  Given her overwhelming focus on Kiev and parts west  she says little about those Ukrainians in Crimea and the Donbass who opposed the Maidan revolt  Generally  they are voiceless   spoken for by Shore herself  or by her pro Maidan interlocutors  who tend to characterize them as troglodytes   The internal political differences produced by Ukraine s history are obscured  or dismissed as backward when they do not align with the ideals of the Maidan 
 The Ukrainian Night  vividly depicts life on the Maidan  It is less effective in uncovering Ukraine s complexities and the roots of a still unfinished revolution 
SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook Inc said on Thursday it had begun  fact checking  photos and videos to reduce the hoaxes and false news stories that have plagued the world s largest social media network 
Facebook has for months faced an uproar among users whose complaints range from the spread of fake news to the use of the network to manipulate elections and the harvesting of 50 million people s Facebook data by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica 
Manipulated photos and videos are another growing problem on social media 
The fact checking began on Wednesday in France with assistance from the news organization AFP and will soon expand to more countries and partners  Tessa Lyons  a product manager at Facebook  said in a briefing with reporters 
Lyons did not say what criteria Facebook or AFP would use to evaluate photos and videos  or how much a photo could be edited or doctored before it is ruled fake 
The project is part of  efforts to fight false news around elections   she said 
A representative for AFP could not immediately be reached for comment 
Shares of Facebook closed up 4 4 percent at  159 79 on Thursday after a tumultuous two weeks  It remained down more than 13 percent from March 16  when Facebook disclosed the Cambridge Analytica data leak and sparked fears of stricter regulation 
Facebook has tried other ways to stem the spread of fake news  It has used third party fact checkers to identify them  and then given such stories less prominence in the Facebook News Feed when people share links to them 
In January  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would prioritize  trustworthy  news by using member surveys to identify high quality outlets 
Samidh Chakrabarti  another Facebook product manager  said in the briefing that the company had begun to  proactively  look for election related disinformation rather than waiting for reports from users  helping it to move more quickly 
Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  said in the briefing that the company was concerned not only about false facts but also other kinds of fakery 
He said Facebook wanted to reduce  fake audiences   which he described as using  tricks  to artificially expand the perception of support for a particular message  as well as  false narratives   such as headlines and language that  exploit disagreements

WELLINGTON  New Zealand    New Zealand s privacy commissioner said Wednesday that Facebook broke the law by not releasing information to a man who wanted to know what others were saying about him on the social network 
Commissioner John Edwards said Facebook refused the man access to personal information that was held on the accounts of several Facebook users  Edwards said the company claimed it wasn t bound by New Zealand s privacy laws and didn t have to comply with a request from his office to take a look at the disputed information 
Facebook said Edwards had made a  broad and intrusive  request for private data  and that the company was protecting its users 
 We are disappointed that the New Zealand privacy commissioner asked us to provide access to a year s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy   the company said in a statement 
The commissioner s finding allows the man to seek financial damages against Facebook  The man wasn t named and it wasn t immediately clear whether he would pursue damages 
The case also raises jurisdictional questions  Edwards said Facebook should comply by New Zealand laws but the company was arguing it s not bound by them because its operation is based in Ireland 
Edwards said Facebook has 2 5 million users in New Zealand  about half of the nation s population  and that it takes money from New Zealand businesses 
 We don t believe there s any credible question that it s operating in New Zealand and is subject to New Zealand laws   he said 
Facebook didn t address the jurisdictional question in its statement 
The company said it had investigated the man s complaint but hadn t got enough detail to resolve it  Facebook said it scrutinized all requests to disclose personal data  particularly the contents of private messages  and would continue to challenge those that were too broad 
 We have a long history of working with the commissioner  and we will continue to request information that will help us investigate this complaint further   the company said 
One course of action for Facebook would be to challenge the commissioner s findings in court  The company did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would pursue legal action 
WASHINGTON    Facebook isn t just a company  It s a behemoth  with 2 1 billion monthly users   40 billion in revenue and more than 25 000 employees worldwide 
And that leaves Washington with a daunting task  How do you tame a corporate giant  Or do you even try 
 It s tricky and it s going to be hard  but there are ways it can be dealt with   says Virginia Sen  Mark Warner  a former tech executive who has led investigations into Russian interference on social media over the last year as the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee   The idea that we re going to keep the wild  wild West   I don t think it s sustainable  
The picture will begin to come into focus next week  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify April 10 and 11 before Senate and House committees as his company grapples with the privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump 
Facebook s reckoning in Washington comes on multiple fronts  Russia s use of the platform to meddle in U S  elections  a regulatory investigation that could result in fines of hundreds of millions of dollars against the company for privacy violations  and the Cambridge Analytica episode are all topmost concerns 
But in the capital s pro business  anti regulatory climate  it s questionable whether the Republican led Congress or Trump regulators have the appetite to rein it in 
Facebook is spending millions on lobbying to try to ward off regulations  even seeking to narrow a Senate bill that lawmakers call  the lightest touch possible   It would require more transparency in online political ads  something Facebook says it is providing on its own 
But the stakes grew Wednesday when Facebook revealed that information belonging to as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica  which gathered the data with the intent of swaying elections  That number was far higher than originally known 
Congress  response to the myriad issues dogging Facebook could depend on Zuckerberg himself  He has apologized for a  major breach of trust  in the Cambridge Analytica episode and Facebook has announced it would stop working with third party data collectors 
Privacy advocates and legal experts say that s not enough 
 It strikes me as a company that is trying to weather a PR storm and then get back to business as usual and hoping their users forget this ever happened   said Nate Cardozo  a senior staff attorney for Electronic Frontier Foundation  a privacy group based in San Francisco 
Facebook and other social media companies have faced bipartisan criticism over both privacy issues and the Russian intervention  But Trump and his pro business GOP allies on Capitol Hill have made rolling back Obama era regulations a priority  which makes any new federal rules for protecting data and privacy unlikely in the immediate future 
Republicans last year struck down online privacy regulations issued during President Barack Obama s final months in office that would have given consumers more control over how companies like Comcast  AT T and Verizon share information  Critics complained that the rule would have increased costs  stifled innovation and picked winners and losers among internet companies 
And Congress elected to do nothing after Equifax disclosed in September that hackers exploited a software flaw that the credit monitoring company failed to fix  exposing Social Security numbers  birthdates and other personal data belonging to nearly 148 million Americans 
Lawmakers have yet to come up with a fix for the patchwork of conflicting state laws that govern how companies shield personal data and notify consumers when breaches occur  Mike Litt  consumer campaign director at U S  PIRG  a public interest group  said Congress instead is considering legislation that would exempt credit bureaus from data break notifications and make it harder for states to hold them accountable 
 After the Equifax data breach  we saw Congress talk a good game but fail to follow through on helping consumers   Litt said   To prevent Congress from letting Facebook off the hook  outraged Americans need to keep up the heat  
To defend its interests in Washington  Facebook has filled its executive ranks with former senior government officials from both political parties  Nathaniel Gleicher  its director of cybersecurity policy  was in charge of cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council during the Obama administration  Joel Kaplan  Facebook s vice president for global public policy  served as a senior aide to President George W  Bush 
The company spent just over  13 million on lobbying in 2017  according to disclosure records filed with Congress  One of the lobbying team s newer members  Sandra Luff  was Attorney General Jeff Sessions  national security adviser when he served in the Senate 
Zuckerberg suggested during a CNN interview last month that he s open to regulation  But he quickly qualified that commitment  saying he d get behind the  right  kind of rules  such as the bill that requires online political ads to disclose who paid for them  But the company is seeking to weaken even that bill 
Warner acknowledged that even minor regulation of Facebook and other technology companies will be difficult  But he s encouraging them to work with Washington now  before a  catastrophic event  that could shift the landscape or if Democrats win back seats in November s elections 
He suggests several possibilities  requiring Facebook and other companies to disclose the country of origin of ads  creating a self regulatory body  or even allowing users to move their data from one platform to another 
More drastic measures could be to allow users to own their own data or to hold social media companies more responsible for what is posted on their platforms 
In Europe  Facebook and other tech giants like Google are bracing for tough new data privacy rules that take effect May 25 and will apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based  The rules will make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data 
In the U S   Facebook s biggest challenge may come from the Federal Trade Commission  which is investigating whether the company violated the terms of a 2011 settlement that made privacy assurances 
Facebook agreed then to settle the commission s charges that it deceived users by assuring them their information would remain private  then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public  Each violation of the agreement could carry a penalty of up to  40 000  according to settlement terms  meaning potential fines in the hundreds of millions 
Frank Pasquale  a University of Maryland law professor who s written extensively about how corporations use personal data  said the federal government s antitrust enforcers should be more vigilant with Facebook 
Facebook has completed dozens of mergers and acquisitions since it was founded in 2004  Pasquale said the Obama administration failed to realize the significance of two of Facebook s largest purchases  the photo sharing app Instagram for  1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp two years later for nearly  22 billion 
 This is clearly a monopolistic company that is trying to eliminate even the smallest challenge to its domination of the social media market   he said 
The privacy scandal has taken a heavy financial toll on Zuckerberg and Facebook  Forbes Magazine estimated that Zuckerberg s net worth dropped over the last month from  71 billion to  61 7 billion  Facebook s market value has fallen by more than  88 billion in less than three weeks since the scandal broke  from nearly  538 billion in mid March to about  449 5 billion

Fair housing advocates have sued Facebook  saying it lets landlords and real estate brokers target advertising to discriminate against families with children  women and others 
The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in New York federal court by the National Fair Housing Alliance and other organizations  It comes as Facebook faces criticism over allegations British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used details of 50 million Facebook users to help Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign 
The housing groups say Menlo Park  California based Facebook has abused its power as the biggest advertising agency in the world 
The lawsuit alleges investigations by fair housing supporters in New York  Washington  D C   Miami and San Antonio  Texas  prove Facebook lets advertisers discriminate  It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to end discrimination 
Facebook hasn t responded to a message seeking comment 
ANNAPOLIS  Md     Maryland s governor must be more permissive of social media commenters who disagree with him under a settlement to resolve a lawsuit that accused him of censoring constituents by blocking them on Facebook  the American Civil Liberties Union said Monday 
The settlement includes a  65 000 payment to the four plaintiffs and a revised social media policy for Republican Gov  Larry Hogan s social media accounts 
The ACLU lawsuit alleged the plaintiffs  First Amendment rights had been violated when Hogan blocked them from his official Facebook page or deleted their comments 
The lawsuit was one of several filed over the past year against high profile elected officials across the country  including President Donald Trump  accusing them of blocking constituents on social media 
Hogan s new social media policy states that he  does not discriminate based on viewpoint  but may remove comments for reasons including profanity or threats of violence  The policy governs Hogan s Facebook  Twitter  Snapchat and YouTube accounts 
Hogan and two aides named as defendants don t admit wrongdoing under the settlement 
 Ultimately  it was much better for Maryland taxpayers to resolve this  than to continue wasting everyone s time and resources in court   Shareese Churchill  a spokeswoman for Hogan  said Monday 
The lawsuit cited a February 2017 Washington Post story that said Hogan and his staff had blocked 450 people from the Facebook page since the time he took office in January 2015 
The governor s office has previously said comments were deleted or people were blocked because of spam or offensive content 
Janice Lepore  one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland lawsuit  said in a statement that she joined the governor s Facebook page to learn about his positions on education issues  When it became clear they disagreed  she said she sought to engage in a social media conversation  She was blocked  according to the lawsuit 
 It never occurred to me that the Governor  or his staff  would seek to prohibit me from engaging in conversations in a public forum  simply because my opinions differ from their positions      I hope this settlement will promote greater access and engagement for all Maryland citizens   Lepore said 
The settlement was approved by the state s Board of Public Works  a three member panel that includes the governor  comptroller and treasurer  and now must be fully implemented within 14 days  according to the ACLU 
 Reuters    Shares of Facebook Inc rose as much as 4 2 percent on Thursday after Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the social network had not seen any meaningful impact on usage or ad sales in the wake of a data privacy scandal 
The company s shares have sunk 16 percent  wiping more than  80 billion from its market value since March 16  when the New York Times and London s Observer newspaper broke news of the use of its data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica 
Some investors see the chaos as a chance to snap up shares in a service for which there is scarce alternative  despite rising public scrutiny and the prospect of a grilling from U S  legislators when Zuckerberg testifies before Congress next week 
Canada s province of British Columbia and Canada s federal government combined investigations on Thursday  saying they had launched a joint probe into Facebook and Canadian data firm AggregateIQ  while Australian authorities said they were exploring whether the social media company had breached user privacy laws 
The California State Teachers  Retirement System  with nearly  1 billion in Facebook stock as of last year  on Thursday also said it would question the company about privacy protections 
Despite the probes and celebrities including singer Cher  actor Will Ferrell and Tesla Chief Elon Musk deleting their accounts  Facebook s social app downloads improved on a monthly basis both in the United States and globally  according to Evercore ISI 
Facebook expanded its share of social app downloads in March by 33 2 percent from 30 1 percent  Evercore data showed

NEW YORK    Facebook says it is making progress weeding out fake accounts and fake news on its service as part of its efforts to prevent election interference ahead of the U S  midterms 
Samidh Chakrabarti  a product manager  said in a conference call Thursday that Facebook is using machine learning to block fake accounts before they spread misinformation  rather than wait for reports from users  Suspicious accounts are then reviewed by humans   similar to ways Facebook monitors other malicious content 
Facebook is also expanding its fact checking efforts beyond the written word to include photos and videos  And it plans to launch a public archive of elections related ads by the summer that will include details such as how much money was spent on each of them and the demographics of their targeted audience 
Guy Rosen  Facebook s vice president of product management  said while these steps are designed to prevent the kind of activity Russian troll accounts took to sow discord in past elections  the company is also looking ahead to prevent new kinds of threats  He didn t provide details on what those might be 
Facebook   along with Twitter and other tech companies   were found to have been played by Russian propagandists seeking to influence elections in a February indictment by U S  special counsel Robert Mueller  The indictment confirmed earlier findings from congressional investigations that Russian agents manipulated social media to promote social division by mimicking grassroots political activity  It also underscores that the problem wasn t just  bots   or automated social media accounts  but human conspirators as well 
Facebook was criticized for responding slowly to evidence of foreign meddling on its service ahead of the 2016 U S  elections 
 None of us can turn back the clock  but we are all responsible for making sure the same kind of attack on democracy does not happen again   Rosen said

NEW YORK    Fair housing advocates sued Facebook Tuesday  saying it lets landlords and real estate brokers target advertising to discriminate against women  those with disabilities and families with children 
The lawsuit in Manhattan federal court alleges investigations by fair housing supporters in New York  Washington  D C   Miami and San Antonio  Texas  prove Facebook continues to let advertisers discriminate even though civil rights and housing groups have notified the company since 2016 that it is violating the federal Fair Housing Act  It seeks unspecified damages and a court order to end discrimination 
Facebook said in a statement that the lawsuit is without merit and the company will defend itself vigorously 
 There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook   the company said 
The lawsuit was filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance and other organizations  It comes as Facebook faces criticism over allegations British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used details of 50 million Facebook users to help Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign 
The housing groups say the Menlo Park  California based Facebook abused its power as it became what amounts to the biggest advertising agency in the world 
The lawsuit s explanation of how the discrimination is carried out begins with a description that would sound appealing to most advertisers  It said Facebook  with a customer base of over 2 billion people  collects a  treasure trove of information  to enable advertisers to target customers they believe are right for their businesses 
Then it lets advertisers scroll through hundreds of demographics  behaviors and interests to decide which characteristics they want to include or exclude  the lawsuit said 
The lawsuit said that the National Fair Housing Alliance did its own study after the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica published an article in October 2016 that said Facebook s online platform enabled advertisers to exclude from advertisements in the housing category those customers assigned black  Hispanic and other  ethnic affinities  
It said the housing alliance was able to post a Facebook ad for a fictitious rental apartment after it selected options that excluded blacks and Hispanics from the ad s potential audience  After complaints  Facebook took steps to counter those kinds of discriminatory ads  the lawsuit said 
But it said additional work by ProPublica and the housing alliance revealed that as recently as weeks ago the company was approving advertising that  in effect  discriminated against mothers  families with young children and those with disabilities 
 Although Facebook stopped approving housing advertisements that used its  ethnic affinity  option in late 2017  it continues to create and develop content that facilitates advertisers excluding certain audiences based on legally protected characteristics   the lawsuit said 
It said Facebook from Dec  14 to Feb  23 had accepted 40 advertisements that the housing alliance and affiliates created that excluded potential home seekers based on family status or gender 
CHICAGO    A judge says a teenager will be sentenced in June after she pleaded guilty to first degree murder in the 2014 fatal shooting of another girl that began as a Facebook feud over a boy 
Associated Judge Stuart Katz on Wednesday postponed the now 18 year old defendant s juvenile court sentencing until June 20  She hasn t been publicly identified because she was 14 when 14 year old Endia Martin was shot and killed  She pleaded guilty in January 
The girl has been in custody for four years  She can only be held until she is 21 because her case is being handled in juvenile court 
The case captured national attention  in large part because of the ages of the two girls and the fact that the shooting stemmed from a petty dispute over a boy 
 Reuters    The European Commission pressed Facebook on Monday over whether EU citizens  data were among those improperly harvested by a British political consultancy  after the U S  regulator said it was investigating the firm s privacy practices 
That piled yet more pressure on a firm that has lost more than  100 billion in market value in the last 10 days 
Facebook shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday after the U S  consumer protection regulator made public its investigation of how the social network allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of Cambridge Analytica 
Facebook executives have apologized after reports emerged that Cambridge Analytica had used personal data to target U S  voters 
 Have any data of EU citizens been affected by the recent scandal   EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova wrote in a letter to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg  seen by Reuters   If this is the case  how do you intend to inform the authorities and users about it  
Jourova said that statements by Facebook executives had not alleviated her concerns 
 This is particularly disappointing given our efforts to build a relationship based on trust with you and your colleagues     this trust is now diminished  
A Facebook spokeswoman said the company remained strongly committed to protecting people s information and appreciated  the opportunity to explain what we know and will respond to the questions that the Commissioner has asked  
Jourova asked Sandberg whether she was certain that a similar situation could  not be repeated today  and if she thought stricter rules were needed for platforms  like those that exist for traditional media  
 As Mark Zuckerberg said this week  we are working hard to tackle past abuse  prevent future abuse and give people more prominent controls   the Facebook spokeswoman said 
Germany s justice minister called for stricter rules for Facebook after meeting with company executives on Monday who said around 1 percent of 300 000 users of a personality quiz whose results were later fed into Cambridge Analytica s voter targeting algorithms were in Europe 
Jourova said she wanted a reply to her letter within two weeks 
The Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged only a few months before a landmark EU data protection law comes into force under which companies found to be in breach could be fined up to 4 percent of global turnover 
Any eventual sanctions for Facebook will fall under the current privacy regulations  and so would be much lower 
Britain s data watchdog is taking the lead in investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica from the European side  and Jourova said she expected the social network to cooperate fully with European data protection authorities

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company s subscribers  The fact is  European regulators are already forcing him to do so 
A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than  1 6 billion under the European Union s new General Data Protection Regulation  which will be enforced from May 25  The rules  approved two years ago  also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents  no matter where it is based

Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after revelations that a Trump affiliated consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data on millions of Facebook users  That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app  even though those friends hadn t given explicit consent to sharing 
Facebook is also facing questions about reports that it collected years of contact names  telephone numbers  call lengths and information about text messages from Android users  Facebook says the data is used  to improve people s experience across Facebook  by helping to connect with others  But the company did not spell out exactly what it used the data for or why it needed it 
European officials also have also been investigating or seeking more information  Germany s justice minister said Monday that she wants closer oversight of companies such as Facebook after a meeting with its executives about the abuse of users  data  Last week  a U K  parliamentary media committee summoned CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about how Facebook uses data  while U K  Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating how Cambridge Analytica got the data

 This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to  what the FTC should have stopped in 2011   Rotenberg said   It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps  they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends  
Although Zuckerberg talked about changes in 2014 that would have prevented this  Rotenberg said it should have been banned already under the 2011 consent decree  He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that 
Meanwhile  state attorneys general asked Zuckerberg for an update on how Facebook will allow users to control the privacy of their accounts more easily 
 Facebook has made promises about users  privacy in the past  and we need to know that users can trust Facebook   they wrote   With the information we have now  our trust has been broken  
In a statement  Facebook s vice president for state and local public policy  Will Castleberry  said the attorneys general  have raised important questions and we appreciate their interest  Our internal review of the situation continues and we look forward to responding  
Facebook s stock  which already took a big hit last week  fell Monday after the FTC announcement but recovered by the end of the day  With Monday s close at  160 06  the stock is down almost 14 percent since March 16  when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke

Facebook said on Tuesday that it had found and removed more than 270 accounts and pages controlled by Russia s Internet Research Agency  the so called troll factory that became notorious for posting fraudulent and divisive material on the platform during the 2016 presidential election 
The company said most of the accounts and pages were in Russian and aimed at users in Russia and neighboring or nearby countries  including Ukraine  Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan  The company did not claim the new accounts and pages had violated the company s policies  but it said they had been taken down because of the Internet Research Agency s past fraud 
Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  told Reuters that the Russian company  which operates under several names   has repeatedly acted to deceive people and manipulate people around the world  and we don t want them on Facebook anywhere  
In a blog post  Facebook s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  said that  uncovering this activity took months of work by our team   He said the company had taken down 70 accounts and 138 pages on Facebook and 65 accounts on Instagram  which Facebook owns 
 We removed this latest set of pages and accounts solely because they were controlled by the I R A    not based on the content   Mr  Stamos wrote   This included commentary on domestic and international political issues  the promotion of Russian culture and tourism as well as debate on more everyday issues  
He said that more than a million people had followed the Facebook pages and that 493 000 had followed the Instagram accounts  He said the company would update a tool on its help center to allow Facebook and Instagram users to find out whether they had followed the pages and users 
The company also removed  167 000 worth of ads purchased by the Russian controlled pages since 2015  Mr  Stamos said 
The Internet Research Agency came to widespread attention with a profile in The New York Times Magazine in 2015 describing how its paid trolls  working in St  Petersburg  posted false stories and inflammatory comments on various sites across the internet 
In September  Facebook disclosed that it had discovered and taken down several hundreds fraudulent profiles and pages  most of them praising Donald J  Trump  denigrating Hillary Clinton or simply spreading inflammatory memes and comments on such divisive issues as race  immigration and guns 
In February  Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election  indicted 13 Russians associated with the Internet Research Agency  including Yevgeny Prigozhin  a Russian businessman with Kremlin ties who the indictment said controlled the Internet Research Agency and related businesses 
None of those Russians have been arrested  and Russia is not expected to extradite any of them to the United States  But the indictments were widely viewed as Mr  Mueller s effort to establish that crimes had been committed in the Russian interference  which President Trump has frequently derided as a  hoax  
The Internet Research Agency and similar operations with ties to Russian government officials have carried out influence operations not only in the United States but also in Russia and many other countries in Eastern and Western Europe  The campaigns have generally reflected Kremlin political goals  attacking critics of Russia inside and outside the country 
Facebook also released in the blog post on Tuesday several examples of the material it had taken down  including a photo of Vladimir V  Putin  the Russian president  offering a toast  scantily clad sunbathers in snowy Siberia  and tourist shots of St  Petersburg  The company said it would make more material public 
Representative Adam Schiff of California  the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee  said he was pleased that Facebook had made its actions public  He said the report  demonstrates that activity linked to the I R A  has continued on social media platforms and did not cease when their activities were exposed last year  
BERLIN    Companies like Facebook must face stricter regulation and tougher penalties meted out by better equipped data protection authorities  Germany s justice minister said on Monday after a meeting with senior executives from the company 
Katarina Barley summoned the bosses  including European public affairs chief Richard Allan  after allegations surfaced that data from millions of its users was improperly used by consultants Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters in close run elections 
 Facebook admitted abuses and excesses in the past and gave assurances that measures since taken mean they can t happen again   she said   But promises aren t enough  In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly  
 Reporting by Thomas Escritt  Editing by Joseph Nasr 
 One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data  
That s what Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive and co founder  said just over a week ago after revelations that the data research firm Cambridge Analytica had gained access to the profiles of 50 million Facebook users 
Over the past year  the downside of social media companies   Facebook foremost among them   has become glaringly apparent  They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives  They have failed to keep users  personal information private  And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be  well  creepy 
Now the drumbeat for regulation of social media on both sides of the aisle   and from many in Silicon Valley   is getting louder by the day   I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary   Tim Cook  Apple s chief executive  said recently 
Mr  Zuckerberg may be getting tired of other executives sniping at his company  but he needs to come up with a solution   fast  For several weeks  I ve been canvassing various technology executives  privacy advocates  academics and others to come up with some ideas about exactly what Facebook could do to fix itself 
It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators  but Mr  Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this  a  Why Me   button   Google  Amazon and others might want to take note  too  
Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it  We provide it all sorts of information  But we have no idea how the information is being used  how our data is being harvested  how that data is being commingled and cross referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers   Facebook already has a button  relatively buried in a list of other items  that it calls  Why Am I Seeing This Ad   It is  to some degree  a crippled version of what I m suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook s properties  
To his credit  Mr  Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns  After acknowledging that protecting users  data is one of the company s biggest responsibilities  he went on to say   If you think about what our services are  at their most basic level  you put some content into a service  whether it s a photo or a video or a text message   whether it s Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram   and you re trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with  
But the solution Facebook offered last week   putting all of your privacy settings on one screen and blocking some third parties from access to data   is just a Band Aid  It s a start  but it doesn t provide a road map for how your information is being used 
That s where the  Why Me   button could help  This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook s properties  including Instagram and WhatsApp 
If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen  you could click the  Why Me   button  Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you 
The  Why Me   explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser  but what keywords  demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted  It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser s request and where that information came from 
Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook  The  Why Me   section would show you when and where that information was collected  Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan  Facebook would tell how it knew that  too 
Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it  The  Why Me   section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross referenced to identify you  Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided  It would tell you that  too 
Most important  at every point in the  explanation tree   the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data  Facebook  of course  could   and probably should   explain the trade offs of such decisions 
The  Why Me   button could also be extended to content  When a friend or company shares a post  Facebook doesn t just display it to everyone listed as the poster s friend or follower  Facebook s algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters  usually related to the kind of content or how you ve interacted with the friend in the past 
The  Why Me   button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted 
The current  Why Am I Seeing This Ad   often says something like   Company A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States  This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you ve connected to the internet  
But it hardly tells you the whole story  Facebook doesn t say so explicitly  but it allows companies to upload their own databases  cross reference them with Facebook s data and use that information to serve ads to users  It also doesn t say how that other site originally got that information about who you are 
In fairness  the  Why Me   button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook  and its advertisers  too  It would allow users   and rivals   to reverse engineer much of the way the system works  And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public  But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting 
It has become something of a cliché  but in 1913  before he became a Supreme Court justice  Louis D  Brandeis said   Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants  
It could well be applied today at Facebook   and its peer companies   if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown 
The recent tribulations of Facebook  which has lurched from crisis to crisis over the last year  most recently over the handling of users  personal data  has pushed a few of the industry s most prominent names to speak out against the company 
Marc Benioff  the chief executive of Salesforce com  has compared the deleterious effects of social media to those of tobacco and alcohol  and has called for more regulation of those tech companies  Timothy D  Cook  Apple s chief executive  has also suggested new regulation protecting personal data might be in order for businesses like Facebook 
 I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary   Mr  Cook said recently at an event in China  referring to Facebook s recent problems 
But don t expect a long lineup of other industry leaders to speak out any time soon 
Although technology companies have their differences  a spirit of comity prevails among its leaders in moments of crisis  For example  technology chiefs have mostly kept quiet about Uber s travails   from its efforts to sidestep law enforcement to a pedestrian death caused by one of its self driving cars   even if they might express their opinions privately 
Representatives from companies as varied as Amazon  Microsoft and Slack declined to comment for this story  Part of the silence  people in the industry say  comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma   knowing that they  too  may one day face the buzz saw of public censure 
Others say companies have little moral standing to criticize Facebook s practices  when they have themselves relied on the social network to acquire customers  using the same ad targeting tools that rely on personal data that have stirred up so much controversy in the context of politics 
 I think we just have to acknowledge the entire industry s complicity with what s happening with Facebook   said Glenn Kelman  chief executive of Redfin  an internet real estate firm   It s almost like we re Inspector Renault in  Casablanca  where we say we re shocked  shocked with what s happening and then a moment later someone hands us our winnings  
 We ve all been advertising avidly on Facebook   Mr  Kelman added 
Many companies are also linked to Facebook through partnerships  professional organizations and a worldview about the power of data that is not all that different from that of Mark Zuckerberg  the chief executive of Facebook 
 It has been really hard for executives to turn their back on the gold mine of big data even in the face of compelling arguments to do so   said Roger McNamee  an early investor in Facebook and a mentor of Mr  Zuckerberg s before becoming one of the company s most vocal detractors   The C E O s who are stepping forward here are taking the long view  
Vanessa Chan  a spokeswoman for Facebook  declined to comment 
There are many critics of Facebook in Silicon Valley  They include former tech workers  venture capitalists and entrepreneurs like Brian Acton  who became a billionaire when Facebook acquired WhatsApp  a messaging company he helped found   It is time   deletefacebook   Mr  Acton posted on Twitter last month 
But there are few active corporate leaders in Silicon Valley who have taken a stand  Most of the handful of chiefs who have spoken out against Facebook have long been forthright on the topic of privacy  It is no coincidence that their businesses do not rely on the collection of personal data to the same degree that most internet companies do  Mr  Cook of Apple  which makes the vast majority of its revenue from the sale of devices  has for years declared that  when an online service is free  you re not the customer   you re the product  
Steve Dowling  a spokesman for Apple  declined to comment 
When asked about the Facebook s difficulties at an event in China recently  Ginni Rometty  chief executive of IBM  said companies needed to give their users better control over their personal information   Ginni has long believed that individuals or customers own their data   not platforms   said Edward Barbini  a spokesman for IBM 
Noah Theran  s spokesman for the Internet Association  a trade group that counts Facebook and Salesforce among its members  though not Apple and IBM  said maintaining privacy and security was a top priority for internet companies 
 Internet companies comply with a wide variety of data privacy and security laws and regulations that are actively enforced by the F T C  and state attorneys general   Mr  Theran said   Trust and comfort with our products and services is essential to a thriving internet  and the internet industry is committed to providing people with information and tools to make informed choices about how their personal information is used  seen and shared online  
Another tech leader  Elon Musk  chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX  said recently on Twitter that none of his companies advertise on the social network and vowed to take down the official Facebook pages for Tesla and SpaceX 
 It s not a political statement and I didn t do this because someone dared me to do it   he wrote   Just don t like Facebook  Gives me the willies  Sorry  
Mr  McNamee  the early Facebook investor  believes more industry leaders should speak out  partly because he predicts the United States can and should eventually adopt more stringent regulations akin to those emerging in Europe 
 Companies that get ahead of that curve   he said   will be way more successful than those who can pretend they can sustain the old model  
As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg landed on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast 
But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide 
 I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted Zuckerberg that afternoon   And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   
Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself 
 The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out his annual  personal challenge  
In 2017  the billionaire sought to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  Facebook 
Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information 
On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices 
Zuckerberg preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn about acknowledging the extent of Facebook s problems 
Is he prepared to do all it will take the right the ship 
 If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become a pointed critic 
 I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  
Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters 
 The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO said at a technology conference 
 I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day 
Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn and a deep sense of reflection 
Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has talked about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of his place in that world seemed like  a burden of responsibility   she said 
With Zuckerberg   its experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004 
But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view  such as when he donated  100 million to Newark  New Jersey  schools in 2010 with few specifics outlining how the money should be spent 
 He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant     but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling the Newark experiment 
Zuckerberg and his wife  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases 
To free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg last year pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  The company dropped the plan 
The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and community but whose individual interests don t always align 
Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   is compelled to share far more about himself than would be expected of another CEO  Yet he fiercely guards his privacy 
 Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  
Shortly before the 2016 election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning the company was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit 
McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since  but Zuckerberg s supporters say he is unfairly blamed 
Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits him with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  nudging users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content 
Kirkpatrick argues  though  that Zuckerberg still must deal with existential threats to Facebook s business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users 
 I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  
McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community 
 You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel   You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero  
As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg s to do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast 
But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide 
 It was one of the last things I asked him  thinking it would put a smile on his face   and it did   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon 
 I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States  And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   
Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself 
 The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out the  personal challenge  that he sets for himself each year 
In 2017  the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  long after critics began demanding an overhaul  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  the platform that he has engineered to build community   but that is increasingly blamed for warping it 
Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information 
On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices 
Throughout the mounting crisis  Zuckerberg s response has been a study in contradictions  He crisscrossed the country  even as his company back home came under increasing fire  He preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning and craves privacy  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook s problems 
Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship  But at 33  is he prepared to do all it will take 
 If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company s most pointed critics 
 I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  
___
Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters 
 The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference 
 I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day   You can certainly say that he was culpable  in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system  But I don t think he was lying  
Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection 
Donald Graham  the former chairman of the Washington Post Co   recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005  outsiders still weren t sure what to make of Facebook 
 I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough   15 seconds  20 seconds   that I would think  Did I insult him  Did he not hear me    said Graham  who went on to serve on the company s board from 2008 to 2015 
 Since I am from Washington  I m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question      But Mark  then as now  was thinking about the right answer  
Zuckerberg s boyish appearance  even today  is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world s biggest social network  back in his dorm room at Harvard 
 I didn t know anything about building a company or global internet service   he wrote in January   Over the years I ve made almost every mistake you can imagine  
Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of that world and his place in it  seemed almost like a gravity  a burden of responsibility   she said 
That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty 
Gleit recalled Zuckerberg s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email  even as more people began using phones to send text messages  But co workers eventually swayed the CEO  whom she described as a  learn it all   That change of mind informed Facebook s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for  19 billion 
 I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong   Gleit said 
With Zuckerberg   it s experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004  Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg s enthusiasm for software  which can be overwritten to fix problems  That facility  he said  makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience 
But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view 
___
In 2010  Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey s television show that he would donate  100 million to schools in Newark  New Jersey 
Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image  just as the biopic  The Social Network  was being released  Still  there was little questioning his generosity  The problem was that Zuckerberg   who knew little about education   made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent 
 He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet  but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling how the money went to high priced consultants  with minimal effort by leaders to build community support 
By the end of the process  Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done  He and his wife  Dr  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases  He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy 
 Zuck s maturation has occurred in front of the public   said Kirkpatrick  author of  The Facebook Effect  The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World     But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature  
At Facebook  Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals  which includes purchasing competitors   or companies that could grow into competitors 
Facebook s  1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012   then unprofitable and little known   came as a shock to Wall Street  Two years later came the multibillion dollar deal to buy WhatsApp  a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U S 
In 2014  soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus  Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets  Under questioning  he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen  and his vision of growing it so fast  that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists  
Last year  in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit  the company dropped the plan 
The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don t always align 
The paradox is self inflicted  the trade off for creating a venture premised on users  willingness to share details of their lives  That requires Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO  whether it s photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year 
Yet he fiercely guards his privacy 
When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee  the company sent its lawyer  And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year  they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians   withdrawn after protests   that would have cut off locals  access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate s boundaries 
 Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  
____
Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business 
Stops on last year s U S  tour  never announced  were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few  But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional quality photos on Zuckerberg s Facebook page soon after he d departed 
Ostensibly  the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn  But in their brief interactions  many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him 
In Hazard  Kentucky  educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town s biggest secret  A staffer from Zuckerberg s foundation  peppering Green with questions about the region s educational cooperative  finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit  Green s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming 
Walking through science demonstrations  Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers

When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston  North Dakota  last July   from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car  he was nothing but questions   said Ron Ness  president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council  which arranged the visit 
 I had Bakken shale  limestone  dolomite  and he was able to hold them in his hand  along with a bottle of crude oil  And I remember him asking   How do you get that oil out of that rock    geologist Kathleen Neset said 
In Dayton  Ohio  Zuckerberg met with officials  caregivers and families battling drug addiction  Lori Erion  the founder of the group Families of Addicts  said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter  April  had shot up heroin in their own home 
 It seemed to get him really emotional   Erion said  recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself  When he returned  he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment 
 We didn t ever talk about Facebook at all   Erion said   which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out  He really was just like a regular person

As Zuckerberg connected with Americans face to face  controversy over Facebook continued to spiral 
Shortly before the election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit 
All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook   that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform 
McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since 
Facebook has adopted this  libertarian philosophy that says  we are not responsible for anything downstream  we are allowed to disrupt media  we are allowed to addict our users and we are not responsible for any of the consequences of any of that    he said 
Zuckerberg could change that  But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through  And tweaking Facebook s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive 
 You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place  which is what Zuck recommends   McNamee wrote in an email 
Critics say Facebook continues to ignore the possibility of the social network being used for dark purposes  but Zuckerberg s supporters counter that he is unfairly blamed for problems he could not have foreseen 
Hoffman  the LinkedIn co founder  credits Zuckerberg with leading Facebook through a shift in mindset  making changes that will nudge users into a more positive virtual environment   without completely shutting out inflammatory content 
 Facebook basically is saying we enable people based on the way they behave  That s a very democratic argument  If people want to live in filter bubbles  who are we to say  Don t live in filter bubbles   even though we don t want them to   Hoffman said 
But Kirkpatrick argued that Zuckerberg s and Sandberg s surety that Facebook has a positive impact on society has blinded them to parallel realities  The company can t be fixed  Kirkpatrick said  until Zuckerberg comes to terms with existential threats to the way the social network does business   its potential to negatively affect democracy and the way it hooks in users 
 There s no question in my mind that Mark Zuckerberg is an ethical and responsible human being who wants to do the right thing   he said   However  I do not think he has yet grasped the gravity with which his service is being perceived to be a socially harmful force all around the world  And I also don t think he realizes the extent to which that really is true  
McNamee  recalling Zuckerberg as a 22 year old visionary  said the CEO must be willing to rethink long held assumptions  But that does not mean he has to abandon building his global community 
 You ve won   McNamee said he would tell Zuckerberg if asked again for his counsel 
 You ve achieved more than your wildest dreams  You re a billionaire  Now you have a chance to be a hero  
SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook employees were in an uproar on Friday over a leaked 2016 memo from a top executive defending the social network s growth at any cost   even if it caused deaths from a terrorist attack that was organized on the platform 
In the memo  Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook vice president  wrote   Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools  And still we connect people  The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is  de facto  good  
Mr  Bosworth and Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  have since disavowed the memo  which was published on Thursday by BuzzFeed News 
But the fallout at the Silicon Valley company has been wide  According to two Facebook employees  workers have been calling on internal message boards for a hunt to find those who leak to the media  Some have questioned whether Facebook has been transparent enough with its users and with journalists  said the employees  who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation  Many are also concerned over what might leak next and are deleting old comments or messages that might come across as controversial or newsworthy  they said 
The brouhaha follows a period of intense scrutiny for Facebook and questions over what its responsibilities are to its more than 2 2 billion users  The company has been grappling this month with revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested data from 50 million of the social network s users  Mr  Zuckerberg has since been on an apology tour over data privacy and is expected to testify before lawmakers in Washington 
Facebook did not respond to a request for comment over employees  reaction to the leaked memo 
In the aftermath  some Facebook executives have taken to Twitter for a public charm offensive  sending pithy phrases and emoticons to reporters who cover the company  Adam Mosseri  Facebook s head of news feed  in recent days wrote unprompted to a BuzzFeed editor and to its chief executive reminiscing and telling a story about his mother  He also wrote to a reporter from the Verge tech site about the songs played at his wedding reception 
In some of his tweets  Mr  Mosseri also defended Facebook  When writers from Vox and BuzzFeed tweeted that they noticed that stories critical of Facebook were receiving surprisingly low levels of traffic on Facebook  Mr  Mosseri jumped in 
 We 100  do not take any action on stories for being critical of us   he tweeted 
Mr  Bosworth  the author of the 2016 memo  also took to Twitter  Late Thursday  he said he did not agree with what he wrote in the memo  and I didn t agree with it even when I wrote it   He added that  the purpose of this post  like many others I have written internally  was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company  
After BuzzFeed published the memo  Mr  Bosworth deleted it from an internal message board where it had originally been posted  In a statement to BuzzFeed  Mr  Zuckerberg praised Mr  Bosworth as  a talented leader who says many provocative things  and said that he and most people at Facebook did not agree with the memo and that the company had realized that it could not just be about connecting people 
Facebook employees said on Friday that discussions were raging across the company regarding the merits of the post  Some called for executives to aggressively pursue action against those leaking to the media  said two Facebook employees  as well as for the company to do more to screen for potential whistle blowers during the hiring process 
At least one former Facebook employee  Alec Muffett  wrote on Twitter that Mr  Bosworth s memo was responsible for his decision to leave the company 
 Between overwork and leadership direction evidenced thusly  I could never stay   wrote Mr  Muffett  who formerly worked as a Facebook engineer 
 There are some amazing engineers working at Facebook  folks who care deeply about user privacy  security  and how people will use the code that they write   Mr  Muffett said later in a message   Alas this episode may not help  to achieve more transparent internal product discussion  he said 
WASHINGTON   Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election   a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month 
Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules  The European rules  which go into effect next month  give people more control over how companies use their digital data 
Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica  the firm connected to the Trump campaign  It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election 
Among Facebook s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed  most  of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested 
The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks   including a rare question and answer session with Mr  Zuckerberg and reporters   came just before Mr  Zuckerberg s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill  where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users  Sheryl Sandberg  Mr  Zuckerberg s top deputy  has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week 
The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica 
Andy Stone  a spokesman for Facebook in Washington  said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica  He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data 
 We wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected   Mr  Zuckerberg told reporters 
It remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica  The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network 
Facebook also released a lengthy document describing how it would protect personal data in the future  In that document  Facebook said its search and account recovery systems had been open to abuse by anyone who already had some information about an individual  such as a phone number or email address  The vulnerability extended to much of the platform s user base before it was closed on Wednesday  Facebook said 
The company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses  The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses 
The company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users  And it will stop using third party data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting 
 It s clear now that we didn t focus enough on preventing abuse   Mr  Zuckerberg said   We didn t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is  That was a huge mistake  and it was my mistake  
The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users  privacy  User data is crucial to the company s business  because it is used to deliver advertising to users 
Mr  Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the company s handling of sensitive user data before the Senate s Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday 
 This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues   said Representatives Greg Walden  Republican of Oregon  and Frank Pallone  Democrat of New Jersey  of the House committee 
Senator Chuck Grassley  the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee  said   With all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms  users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured  
Facebook s problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica  to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election  Mr  Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a  crazy idea  
Since then  the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign  Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters 
All those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company  and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks 
In response  the company has put its executives front and center 
Mr  Zuckerberg typically talks to groups of reporters only after the company releases its quarterly financial reports  But after not responding in public for several days following the Cambridge Analytica disclosure  he has given a series of interviews 
And Ms  Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company  is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News   PBS NewsHour   NBC s  Today  show and Bloomberg  Ms  Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California 
Facebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously 
In Washington  Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures  including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand 
On Wednesday  Mr  Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week  He said Facebook was  an idealistic and optimistic company  
But he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users 
Asked if he should still be leading the company  he said   Yes  Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward  
Terrell McSweeny  a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission  said that Mr  Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington 
 I think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust   Ms  McSweeny said   Consumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused  
JACKSON  Mich     A jury has convicted a Michigan man of first degree felony murder after he was accused of breaking into a home and shooting a woman while streaming the attack on Facebook Live

NEW YORK    Facebook s CEO apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal with ads in multiple U S  and British newspapers Sunday  saying the social media platform doesn t deserve to hold personal information if it can t protect it 
The ads signed by Mark Zuckerberg said a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago   This was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time  We re now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again   the ads said 
Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump s 2016 election campaign  got data inappropriately  The firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society 
Facebook s stock value has dropped more than  70 billion since the revelations were first published 
Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U S  and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom 
The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps receive when users sign in  It s also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data   We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected   the ads stated 
Zuckerberg closed the ads by saying   I promise to do better for you  
Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million 
The Trump campaign paid the firm  6 million during the 2016 election  although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge 
As questions mounted last year about whether Facebook had been exploited to tilt the U S  presidential election  Mark Zuckerberg s to do list landed him on a fishing trawler off Alabama s Gulf coast 
But the chatter surrounding the CEO s arrival in port was that it signaled something bigger than just the start of a 30 state personal tour  his designs on a job even more powerful than leading the social network that links 2 2 billion people worldwide 
 It was one of the last things I asked him  thinking it would put a smile on his face   and it did   said Dominick Ficarino  who owns a shrimp business in Bayou La Batre  Alabama  and hosted a dockside lunch for Zuckerberg that Sunday afternoon 
 I asked him if he was interested in running for president of the United States  And his answer to me was   Can I answer you with a question  If you were me  would you   
Thirteen months later  Zuckerberg no longer has the luxury of mulling a hypothetical next act  Instead  he is grappling with a crisis that has enveloped the company synonymous with his face and name  It does not help that the most glaring reminder of Facebook s flaws is the unabated uproar over the American presidency itself 
 The world feels anxious and divided  and Facebook has a lot of work to do   Zuckerberg wrote in January  laying out the  personal challenge  that he sets for himself each year 
In 2017  the billionaire challenged himself to travel to every state he d never visited  This year  long after critics began demanding an overhaul  Zuckerberg said his personal goal is to  fix  the platform that he has engineered to build community   but that is increasingly blamed for warping it 
Yet things continue to get worse  Scrutiny of Facebook has intensified following reports that it failed to prevent the data mining firm Cambridge Analytica from amassing personal information about millions of users   possibly used to aid Donald Trump s campaign   and that the social network has been collecting Android users  phone call and text message histories without notice  That adds to criticism that Facebook manipulates its users and has allowed Russian bots to divide Americans by spreading false information 
On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission announced it was investigating Facebook for its privacy practices 
Throughout the mounting crisis  Zuckerberg s response has been a study in contradictions  He crisscrossed the country  even as his company back home came under increasing fire  He preaches transparency  but flinches at questioning and craves privacy  He is undeniably brilliant  but stubborn in his reluctance to acknowledge the extent of Facebook s problems 
Even his critics say he is uniquely capable of righting the ship  But at 33  is he prepared to do all it will take 
 If he fails to do it  it may take a while but eventually people are going to rebel   said Roger McNamee  an early Facebook investor and adviser who has become one of the company s most pointed critics 
 I thought Facebook was a force for good in the world for a really long time   McNamee said   I think it s really hard to make that case today  
___
Days after Trump s election  Zuckerberg was pressed on the possibility that foreign agents had used his social network to divide voters 
 The idea that fake news on Facebook     influenced the election in any way  I think  is a pretty crazy idea   the CEO told the audience at a California technology conference 
 I think all of us were shocked to learn how wrong he was   said David Kirkpatrick  the author of a 2010 book about Facebook who questioned Zuckerberg that day   You can certainly say that he was culpable  in that he was naive and inattentive to what was happening in his system  But I don t think he was lying  
Zuckerberg walked back the remark soon after  continuing a years long routine of self correction  But errors that reflect his stubbornness  those who know him say  are tempered by an eagerness to learn from mistakes and a deep sense of reflection 
Donald Graham  the former chairman of the Washington Post Co   recalled that when he met Zuckerberg in 2005  outsiders still weren t sure what to make of Facebook 
 I would ask him a question and he would pause long enough   15 seconds  20 seconds   that I would think  Did I insult him  Did he not hear me    said Graham  who went on to serve on the company s board from 2008 to 2015 
 Since I am from Washington  I m not used to people thinking before they are answering a question      But Mark  then as now  was thinking about the right answer  
Zuckerberg s boyish appearance  even today  is a reminder of just how young he was when he created what would become the world s biggest social network  back in his dorm room at Harvard 
 I didn t know anything about building a company or global internet service   he wrote in January   Over the years I ve made almost every mistake you can imagine  
Naomi Gleit  Facebook s longest serving employee after the CEO  said Zuckerberg   who declined an interview request from The Associated Press   has been talking about making the world a better place since he was 21  But his view of that world and his place in it  seemed almost like a gravity  a burden of responsibility   she said 
That seriousness coincides with a sense of certainty 
Gleit recalled Zuckerberg s steadfast attachment to a Facebook message service similar to email  even as more people began using phones to send text messages  But co workers eventually swayed the CEO  who she described as a  learn it all   That change of mind informed Facebook s 2014 purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service for  19 billion 
 I think he would even say now that he was initially wrong   Gleit said 
With Zuckerberg   its experiment  learn  experiment  learn   said LinkedIn co founder Reid Hoffman  who has known him since 2004  Hoffman said that is evident in Zuckerberg s enthusiasm for software  which can be overwritten to fix problems  That facility  he said  makes Zuckerberg the equal of executives with far more experience 
But in the process of learning  Zuckerberg s inexperience has sometimes played out in public view 
___
In 2010  Zuckerberg announced on Oprah Winfrey s television show that he would donate  100 million to schools in Newark  New Jersey 
Critics labeled it an attempt to polish his image  just as the biopic  The Social Network  was being released  Still  there was little questioning his generosity  The problem was that Zuckerberg   who knew little about education   made the gift with few specifics outlining how it should be spent 
 He was just a very young  naive  inexperienced guy who was brilliant at technology and computers and the internet  but just really didn t know much about how the world worked   said Dale Russakoff  author of  The Prize   a book chronicling how the money went to high priced consultants  with minimal effort by leaders to build community support 
By the end of the process  Zuckerberg had developed a clearer understanding of how to get things done  He and his wife  Dr  Priscilla Chan  have since chartered their own foundation and structured it to take on mammoth goals  like a  3 billion investment to cure  prevent or manage all diseases  He has pledged to donate 99 percent of his Facebook stock to philanthropy 
 Zuck s maturation has occurred in front of the public   said Kirkpatrick  author of  The Facebook Effect  The Inside Story of the Company that Is Connecting the World     But he also still lives with the consequences of the decisions he made when he was less mature  
At Facebook  Zuckerberg has grown increasingly bold in using huge sums of money to pursue corporate goals  which includes purchasing competitors   or companies that could grow into competitors 
Facebook s  1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012   then unprofitable and little known   came as a shock to Wall Street  Two years later came the multibillion dollar deal to buy WhatsApp  a company that remains unprofitable but has given Facebook a prime portal into developing countries and other regions outside the U S 
In 2014  soon after Facebook bought a virtual reality firm called Oculus  Zuckerberg found himself being grilled in a lawsuit brought by a competitor who accused an Oculus executive of stealing trade secrets  Under questioning  he talked about the pressure he exerted to make the Oculus deal happen  and his vision of growing it so fast  that we can get every developer and studio in the world building just for Oculus before any big competitor exists  
Last year  in a bid to free up his fortune for philanthropy  Zuckerberg pushed board members to restructure Facebook s stock  allowing him to sell off part of his stake while maintaining control  That prompted a suit by a group of shareholders who argued that the move would benefit only Zuckerberg while diluting the value of other investors  stakes  Days before Zuckerberg was scheduled to testify as part of the suit  the company dropped the plan 
The gambit hints at the complexity of being Zuckerberg  who advocates for transparency and the interests of the community but whose individual interests don t always align 
The paradox is self inflicted  the trade off for creating a venture premised on users  willingness to share details of their lives  That requires Zuckerberg  who has 105 million Facebook  friends   to reveal far more about himself than would be expected of any other CEO  whether its photos of him and Chan baking sweets for the Jewish holiday of Purim or dressing their daughters for the Chinese New Year 
Yet he fiercely guards his privacy 
When calls went out last year for Zuckerberg to testify before a Senate committee  the company sent its lawyer  And when he and Chan bought 700 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last year  they quietly filed lawsuits against hundreds of Hawaiians   withdrawn after protests   that would have cut off locals  access to the land by negating their interest in small ancestral tracts within the estate s boundaries 
 Intellectually  he believes in transparency   Kirkpatrick said   But emotionally  it s very difficult for him  
____
Facebook works hard to present Zuckerberg as someone deeply interested in the ordinary people whose lives are at the heart of its business 
Stops on last year s U S  tour  never announced  were set up by facilitators who revealed details to only a select few  But many of the visits were covered by the media and documented in professional quality photos on Zuckerberg s Facebook page soon after he d departed 
Ostensibly  the idea was for Zuckerberg to learn  But in their brief interactions  many people were just as interested in finding a way to connect with him 
In Hazard  Kentucky  educator Paul Green became custodian of the small town s biggest secret  A staffer from Zuckerberg s foundation  peppering Green with questions about the region s educational cooperative  finally admitted it was because the CEO himself wanted to visit  Green s reward for keeping it quiet was seeing the wide eyed grins when Zuckerberg pulled up and greeted local high schoolers studying robotics and programming 
Walking through science demonstrations  Zuckerberg spent more time trading tech tales with the teenagers than quizzing the teachers 
 He just lit up with those kids   Green said   The way he talked with them about some of the things he did when he was in school and his passion for technology  it really was cool  
When Zuckerberg toured an oil rig near Williston  North Dakota  last July   from the minute he got out of the car to the minute he got back in the car  he was nothing but questions   said Ron Ness  president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council  which arranged the visit 
 I had Bakken shale  limestone  dolomite  and he was able to hold them in his hand  along with a bottle of crude oil  And I remember him asking   How do you get that oil out of that rock    geologist Kathleen Neset said 
In Dayton  Ohio  Zuckerberg met with officials  caregivers and families battling drug addiction  Lori Erion  the founder of the group Families of Addicts  said she told him what it was like to learn her daughter  April  had shot up heroin in their own home 
 It seemed to get him really emotional   Erion said  recalling how Zuckerberg stood up suddenly and told the group he needed a few minutes to steady himself  When he returned  he asked what makes an addict stay clean and how families got their loved ones into treatment 
 We didn t ever talk about Facebook at all   Erion said   which is really interesting because Facebook is really the main way of us getting information out  He really was just like a regular person

Shortly before the election  McNamee sent a letter to Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  warning that Facebook was being manipulated in ways its creators never intended  It wasn t just about the U S  election  A consulting firm had collected data on people interested in the Black Lives Matter movement and sold it to police departments  and critics had detected a well organized  clandestine campaign supporting Brexit 
All this pointed to a deep problem with Facebook   that it was simply not equipped or not willing to prevent the misuse of its platform 
McNamee said he has been disappointed in the incremental changes announced since

Zuckerberg could change that  But McNamee said it is not enough to hire thousands of workers to weed through fake and abusive posts if those posts keep getting through  And tweaking Facebook s newsfeed so users see more posts from families and friends does not address his certainty that the algorithms underlying Facebook make it dangerously addictive 
 You cannot cure addiction by doing more of the thing that got you addicted in the first place  which is what Zuck recommends   McNamee wrote in an email

NEW YORK    Twitter says it will ban or restrict advertisements related to cryptocurrencies in an attempt to crack down on fraud  The move follows similar steps by Facebook and Google earlier this year 
Twitter said the new rules will roll out starting Tuesday and will apply to all advertisers in about a month  The new policy prohibits ads for initial coin offerings  in which a startup issues a currency that can be used to buy services with the company 
Ads for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services  meanwhile  will be restricted and limited to those that are provided by a public company under Twitter s new policy 
The price of a bitcoin dropped below  8 000 on Monday 
Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data 
The system  which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks  will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform 
From the new page  users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them  such as their political preferences or interests  and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them  Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information 
Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network  The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people  leading to a  DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism 
 The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies  and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  a Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement announcing the new system   We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed  
The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years  with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month  people familiar with the decision have said 
Last week  Mr  Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings 
 One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data   he told The New York Times last week   Whenever there s an issue where someone s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn t have allowed it to  that s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar 
Late Wednesday  Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third party data brokers  These are business to business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits  health concerns  income range and preferred credit card 
The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian  Acxiom and Oracle s Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users  But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option  called  Partner Categories  
 We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories   Graham Mudd  a product marketing director at Facebook  said in a statement 
 This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook   he added   While this is common industry practice  we believe this step  winding down over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook  
In 2012  the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law  to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers  
How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook s data privacy practices was unclear  Some privacy advocates noted  for instance  that the company s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past 
 The platform made similar promises many times before   said Zeynep Tufekci  an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society  She pointed out that in 2010  Mr  Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would  add privacy controls that are much simpler to use  
Yet eight years later  the same concerns have resurfaced  Ms  Tufekci said 
 The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves  aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C E O    she said 
Fair housing groups filed a lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday saying that Facebook continues to discriminate against certain groups  including women  disabled veterans and single mothers  in the way that it allows advertisers to target the audience for their ads  The suit comes as the social network is scrambling to deal with an international crisis over the misuse of data belonging to 50 million of its users 
Facebook  an advertising behemoth with more than two billion users a month  provides advertisers with the ability to customize their messages and target who sees them by selecting from preset lists of demographics  likes  behaviors and interests  while excluding others 
Pet food companies  for example  could send their ads specifically to people who had indicated an interest in dogs  while excluding cat and bird fanciers 
When it comes to housing and employment ads  Facebook  in response to criticism over the last 17 months  has repeatedly promised that it would crack down on advertisers who use those same tools to show housing or employment ads to whites only 
But in the lawsuit filed Tuesday in U S  District Court in Manhattan  the National Fair Housing Alliance and affiliated groups in New York  San Antonio and Miami contend that Facebook s advertising platform  continues to enable landlords and real estate brokers to bar families with children  women and others from receiving rental and sales ads for housing  
Diane L  Houk of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff   Abady  a lawyer who worked on the lawsuit  said the groups want the court to require Facebook to take action 
 We want the court to order Facebook to develop a plan to remove any ability for advertisers to access Facebook s checklists for excluding groups of people in the posting of housing related ads   Ms  Houk said   Because of Facebook s impact on the housing market  we ll ask the court to implement a plan of community education and outreach to housing providers to inform them of their obligation not to discriminate  
The suit says Facebook s actions are a violation of the Fair Housing Act  which makes it illegal to publish housing ads that indicate preferences or limitations based on race color  religion  handicaps  familial status or national origin 
 Facebook s ability to customize an online audience for advertisements based on its vast trove of user data has made it the biggest advertising agency in the world   the advertising platform of choice for millions of businesses   the lawsuit states   But Facebook has abused its enormous power  
The criticisms go directly to the heart of Facebook s business  The social network earned nearly all of its more than  40 billion in revenue in 2017 by selling ads on its network 
 There is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook  We believe this lawsuit is without merit  and we will defend ourselves vigorously   a Facebook spokesman said 
The lawsuit is only the latest problem for Facebook  Earlier this month  Facebook became embroiled in a major crisis over the mishandling of data from 50 million users  The information was ultimately used by Cambridge Analytica  which was working on behalf of Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign 
State and federal regulators are now assessing whether the transfer of data violated privacy agreements struck under prior consent decrees  Facebook is the subject of privacy investigations in Europe as well  As a result  the company s stock price has swooned with investors fearing the prospect of new regulations 
 Facebook is essential to the information flow that comprises our public discourse   said Olivier Sylvain  a law professor at Fordham Law School  who is not involved in the suit   But in that role  they should take on the responsibility of minding the flow of information  including the algorithms that produce the results  
To test its case  the National Fair Housing Alliance created an ad for a fictitious apartment rental in Washington  D C   using Facebook s features to exclude  corporate moms    stay at home moms  and other categories that would eliminate women from the ad s potential audience  Facebook estimated that the ads would reach 48 000 to 820 000 people  the lawsuit said 
In New York  the Fair Housing Justice Center created an ad for a rental apartment by selecting  no kids  and  men  from the inclusion list and  moms of grade school kids  and other groups from the exclusion list  Facebook estimated that the ad would reach 280 000 people 
The lawsuit says that Facebook also provides  interests  categories for housing ads that permit a landlord or real estate agent to exclude users based on disability related factors  like  Interest in Disabled Parking Permit   or  disabled veteran   and on the basis of national origin  by eliminating those with  say  an  Interest in Telemundo   the Spanish language television network  or English as a second language 
 The way people find housing in 2018 is radically different than when the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968   said Robert Schwemm  a law professor at the University of Kentucky and author of  Housing Discrimination  Law and Litigation  
But  he added   the Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to target certain groups while excluding others  
 The courts have taken discriminatory housing ads very seriously   he said 
Some online companies accused of discrimination have cited the 1996 Communications Decency Act as a defense  That law essentially says that platforms that merely allow third parties to post material cannot be held liable for something that is discriminatory 
But  Mr  Schwemm said  Facebook is another matter 
 By allowing housing advertisers to click certain boxes in order to refine their ads and exclude certain protected groups  Facebook is more than just a neutral conveyor of information  like  say  a phone company  which is not liable for its customers  discriminatory ads or statements  
ProPublica  a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to investigative journalism  raised the issue of discriminatory housing ads in an October 2016 article that described how advertisers could keep users who were black  Hispanic or had other  ethnic affinities  from seeing housing ads 
That got the attention of the National Fair Housing Alliance  which sent a letter to Facebook saying that its ad practices appeared to violate fair housing laws and asked for a meeting  In November 2016  Facebook said it would disable the use of  ethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify as offering housing employment or credit  
A year ago  Facebook said its policy expressly forbid ads that have discriminatory content 
But a second article by ProPublica in November found that housing ads that specifically excluded African Americans  people interested in wheelchair ramps  Jews and Spanish speakers could still be placed on Facebook s platform 
The following month  an article by The New York Times and ProPublica found that national employers like Verizon  Goldman Sachs and Amazon had placed job recruitment ads limited to certain age groups  while hundreds of millions of other internet users never saw the ads 
 We thought they were sincere   said Lisa Rice  president of the National Fair Housing Alliance   But they have not changed their content  their platform and their systems to preclude advertisers from discriminating  When you think that Facebook has over two billion active users  that s pretty significant  
BRASILIA    A Brazilian judge has ordered that Facebook Inc pay 111 7 million reais   33 4 million  for failing to cooperate with a corruption investigation  federal prosecutors said on Thursday  prompting Facebook to say it was exploring  all legal options  
The judge fined Facebook for failing to give access in 2016 to WhatsApp messages exchanged by individuals under investigation for defrauding the healthcare system of Brazil s Amazonas state  the prosecutors said in a statement 
In an emailed comment sent to Reuters  Facebook called the fine groundless 
 Facebook cooperates with law enforcement  In this particular case we have disclosed the data required by applicable law   the statement said   We understand this fine lacks grounds  and are exploring all legal options at our disposal  
According to federal police  a Brazilian judge ordered in April 2016 that Facebook give authorities access to the WhatsApp messages in question 
The fine amounted to 1 million reais plus interest for every day Facebook did not comply with the order  beginning when it took effect in mid June 2016  and ending when the corruption investigation was made public that September  police said 
Through the probe known as  Operacao Maus Caminhos   or  Operation Bad Paths   federal police exposed the embezzlement of tens of millions of reais of public funds

JEFFERSON CITY  Mo     Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley is demanding information from Facebook following allegations that the social media giant mishandled user data 
The Republican Senate candidate announced Monday that his office issued a civil investigative demand  which functions like a subpoena  It seeks details on how Facebook collects and shares user information 
Facebook didn t immediately comment when contacted by The Associated Press 
Hawley is among 37 attorneys general who signed a letter last week asking Facebook similar questions  The Federal Trade Commission is also investigating 
Hawley s announcement follows revelations that a consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump got data on millions of unsuspecting Facebook users  Facebook is also facing criticism for collecting years of data on call and text histories from Android users 
Hawley is running for Democratic U S  Sen  Claire McCaskill s seat 
MOSCOW    Russia s communications watchdog said on Friday it had asked Facebook to explain why access had been restricted to the Facebook accounts of some Russian media organizations  RIA news agency said 
Roskomnadzor said it considered the restrictions to be a continuation of Facebook s  unfriendly policy toward Russian users   RIA said 
The report did not specify which accounts had been affected  but Roskomnadzor said the move by Facebook would make it harder for Russian and foreign social network users to follow the Russian news agenda 
Facebook said on Tuesday it had deleted hundreds of Russian accounts and pages associated with a  troll factory  indicted by U S  prosecutors for fake activist and political posts in the 2016 U S  election campaign 
Facebook said many of the deleted articles and pages came from Russia based Federal News Agency  known as FAN  which they linked to the St Petersburg based Internet Research Agency 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters on Tuesday that the agency had  repeatedly acted to deceive people and manipulate people around the world  and we don t want them on Facebook anywhere

A number of anti Semitic episodes have shaken France  and the speed with which the authorities labeled Ms  Knoll s killing  in the apartment building above  a hate crime is being seen as a reaction to anger at the official response to the murder last year of another older Jewish woman

BRUSSELS    The European Union said Friday that Facebook has told it that up to 2 7 million people in the 28 nation bloc may have been victim of improper data sharing involving political data mining firm Cambridge Analytica 
EU spokesman Christian Wigand said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova will have a telephone call with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg early next week to address the massive data leaks 
The EU and Facebook will be looking at what changes the social media giant needs to make to better protect users and how the U S  company must adapt to new EU data protection rules 
Wigand said that EU data protection authorities will discuss over the coming days  a strong coordinated approach  on how to deal with the Facebook investigation 
Separately  Italy s competition authority opened an investigation Friday into Facebook for allegedly misleading practices following revelations that the social network sold users  data without consent 
Authority chairman Giovanni Pitruzzella told Sky News24 that the investigation will focus on Facebook s claims on its home page that the service is free  without revealing that it makes money off users  data 
The investigation comes as Italian consumer advocate group Codacons prepares a U S  class action against Facebook on behalf of Italians whose data was mined by Cambridge Analytica  Codacons said just 57 Italians downloaded the Cambridge Analytica app  but that an estimated 214 000 Italians could be affected because the data mined extended to also the users  friends 
A top Facebook privacy official is scheduled to meet with the authority later this month

This story was earlier corrected to show that the EU call will take place with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg not with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
NEW YORK    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares to face Congress on Tuesday  and No  2 executive Sheryl Sandberg is on a media blitz as the company tries to contain swirling concerns about how it protects the data of its 2 2 billion members 
Facing its most serious challenge in its 14 year history  the social media juggernaut is seeking to maintain people s trust and avoid a user exodus 
Here s a look at the scandal and what it means 
___
HOW DID THIS START 
In mid March  news broke that Cambridge Analytica  a London based data mining firm with ties to U S  President Donald Trump  lifted the Facebook profiles of tens of millions of users without their permission in an attempt to sway elections 
A former Cambridge Analytica employee  Christopher Wylie  said the firm got Facebook information through an app in order to build psychological profiles on a large portion of the U S  electorate  That app vacuumed up information from users who gave the app permission to access their accounts   as well as additional data from their Facebook friends  About 270 000 people were paid to take part  tens of millions of their friends were also caught in the data dragnet 
___
WHY ARE PEOPLE MAD AT FACEBOOK 
The crisis appears to have crystallized the anxiety many people feel about Facebook s enormous sway over daily life and its massive data trove 
It comes on the heels of a revelation that Russia used the service to meddle in U S  elections  It has also deepened concerns about the social media network s ability to avoid being exploited to spread propaganda and sway elections 
And it has renewed questions about Facebook s ability to protect the privacy of its users while also exploiting their personal details to fuel its lucrative advertising business 
Facebook s stock has fallen about 14 percent since the Cambridge Analytica story broke  more than the rest of the stock market has fallen   Some advertisers and users have left Facebook  although the company has said it hasn t been a significant number yet 
___
WHAT S THE SCOPE OF THIS SCANDAL 
The number of people affected seems to keep ballooning  On Wednesday  Facebook said that as many as 87 million people might have had their data accessed   up from the 50 million disclosed in previously published reports 
And Facebook said it believes most of its 2 2 billion users have had their public profile information scraped by  malicious actors  at some point  That s through a feature that lets people search for users through their email address or phone number  While this helped individuals find friends  Facebook says malicious actors have also used this technique  Outside experts believe they could have been identity thieves  scam artists or shady data brokers assembling marketing profiles 
On top of that  some users who logged in to Facebook through Android devices discovered that Facebook had been collecting phone call logs and text histories 
___
HOW HAS FACEBOOK RESPONDED 
Zuckerberg and Sandberg were silent for five days following the initial report  Zuckerberg also was criticized for initially failing to apologize when he did break the silence 
Since then  they ve been on a major offensive  apologizing on national TV and rolling out new privacy policies  In a call with reporters Wednesday  Zuckerberg acknowledged he made a  huge mistake  in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook s responsibility is in the world 
___
IS FACEBOOK CHANGING ITS PRACTICES 
Facebook has outlined a new privacy policy that aims to explain the data it gathers on users more clearly  It s also restricting access that apps can have to data about users  events  as well as information about groups such as member lists and content  In addition  the company is removing the option to search for users by entering a phone number or an email address 
Facebook is trying to be more upfront with users  On Monday  all Facebook users will receive a notice on their Facebook feeds with a link to see what apps they use and what information they have shared with those apps  They ll have a chance to delete apps they no longer want  Users who might have had their data shared with Cambridge Analytica will be told of that 
___
WHY IS WASHINGTON INVOLVED 
Congress has been interested in increasing regulation on Facebook due to its size and the myriad of issues it s facing  That includes data privacy  fake news and Russian meddling in the U S  elections 
Zuckerberg is set to testify on the privacy scandal Tuesday before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees  and a day later before the House Energy and Commerce Committee  The two sessions will be his first testimony before Congress  Separately  the U S  Federal Trade Commission and various authorities in Europe are investigating 
Meanwhile  special counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing the connections between Trump s campaign and Cambridge Analytica so he ll be interested in whatever Zuckerberg has to say  too 
___
AP Business Writers Alexandra Olson and Barbara Ortutay in New York contributed to this report 
WASHINGTON    Investigators on two congressional panels are looking into whether Russia acquired the data of millions of Facebook users and if companies with ties to then 2016 Republican election candidate Donald Trump s campaign played any role in providing it  three sources familiar with the inquiries said 
On Tuesday  Facebook said it had deleted 70 Facebook accounts  138 Facebook pages and 65 Instagram accounts that it said were  controlled  by the Internet Research Agency  IRA   a  Russian propaganda arm based in St  Petersburg 
Last September  Facebook disclosed that it had suspended about 470  inauthentic accounts  that it believed were  likely operated out of Russia  and had purchased 3 000 ads which  appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages  
And on Wednesday  the social media platform said the personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify on April 10 and 11 to Congress 
In an indictment in February  Robert Mueller  the special counsel investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential campaign  charged IRA and 13 Russians with conspiring to interfere in U S  politics and elections  Moscow denies tampering in U S  elections and President Trump denies any coordination between his campaign and Russian officials 
Among the issues investigators on the U S  Senate Intelligence Committee and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are digging into are whether IRA and other Russian organizations used any Facebook data  the sources said  speaking on condition of anonymity  Also  whether the use of such data had any impact on the U S  election  and how much Facebook data may have been acquired by Russian entities  the sources said 
Zuckerberg last month disclosed that in 2013  Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan  who ran a company called Global Science Research  GSR   created a personality quiz app that was installed by about 300 000 Facebook users 
Zuckerberg said that because of the way the Facebook platform worked at the time  this gave Kogan access to data of  tens of millions  of friends of users who took the quiz 
On Wednesday  Mike Schroepfer  Facebook s Chief Technology Officer  acknowledged in a public posting that  the Facebook information of up to 87 million people   mostly in the US   may have been improperly shared  with Cambridge Analytica 
Zuckerberg said Facebook learned in 2015 that Kogan shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica  The London based consulting firm received millions of dollars from the Trump campaign and a political action committee supported by financier Robert Mercer  who supported Trump  Zuckerberg said Kogan  misused  Facebook s data 
Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Wednesday that it  did not use any  data it acquired from Kogan s company in work related to the 2016 U S  presidential campaign  The firm added that it took legal action against GSR  and that it  immediately deleted the raw data  from its server when it learned from Facebook that the data had been  improperly obtained  
Representative Adam Schiff  the House intelligence committee s top Democrat  sent Kogan a letter requesting correspondence and message traffic on his dealings with Cambridge Analytica and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon  any material related to Russia  and that Kogan agree to an interview 
Kogan said in an email to Reuters that he knows nothing about Facebook data being obtained by Russia and had never heard of the Internet Research Agency  until a few weeks ago

  Mark Zuckerberg  the social media giant s chief executive  publicly addressed the crisis facing his company  five days after reports about the misuse of data from 50 million of its users 
 We also made mistakes  there s more to do  and we need to step up and do it   he wrote in a statement outlining the steps Facebook would take to better protect users  information  He also spoke to The Times about his plans for change 
Given that the gathering of user data is fundamental to the company s operations  lawmakers and researchers were unimpressed by Mr  Zuckerberg s mea culpa   He avoided the big issue  which is that for many years  Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy   a Columbia University researcher said

On this day in 1972  the U S  Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v  Baird that it s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception 
The court had ruled earlier  in 1965  that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights  But a few states still restricted access for single people 
Bill Baird  an activist  violated one such law in Massachusetts  He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court  which struck down the law 
Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people 
The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court  including the 1973 decision in Roe v  Wade that recognized abortion rights  and  more recently  the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same sex marriage 
A movie about Mr  Baird s case is in development 
Mr  Baird has continued working as an activist  but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an  unapologetic zealotry  and a willingness to criticize  even his ideologic allies   Planned Parenthood once called him an  embarrassment

SAN FRANCISCO   For the past week  Mark Zuckerberg has grappled with a backlash from lawmakers  regulators and users over Facebook s mishandling of data privacy  He has also had to face another restive group  his own employees 
The Facebook chief executive has taken multiple steps over the past few days to communicate with the social network s 25 000 employees over revelations last week that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  had improperly obtained data of 50 million Facebook users 
The Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica  featuring one of Facebook s lawyers  Paul Grewal  On Wednesday afternoon  Mr  Zuckerberg addressed employees directly  according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential  Mr  Zuckerberg also spoke with staff on Friday at a regularly scheduled employee meeting  said two people who attended the event 
Facebook declined to comment on the meetings 
Speaking to Facebook s employees was a crucial prong of what has become an apology tour of sorts for Mr  Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica fallout  The revelations have raised calls for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear before Congress to explain himself  as well as a  DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism 
Mr  Zuckerberg had stayed silent on the matter for days  until he released a statement on Wednesday vowing that Facebook had to do better and gave several interviews to quell the crisis  That has not stopped pressure from Congress  with bipartisan leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee saying on Friday that they had sent a formal request for Mr  Zuckerberg to appear in a hearing over Facebook s  harvesting and sale of personal information  related to Cambridge Analytica 
Calming employees was particularly vital because morale had sunk at the company  Facebook employees have said  especially after months of scrutiny over how the social network was used by Russian agents to influence the 2016 presidential election  Keeping workers engaged is crucial in Silicon Valley s highly competitive job market  where recruiting and retaining talent often is difficult against deep pocketed rivals 
Earlier this week  some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company  such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo sharing site Instagram  which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals 
One Facebook recruiter  who declined to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement  said there were concerns that top talent might choose other Silicon Valley companies over Facebook 
 It s such a shocking difference for company employees who are used to having esteem for where they work   said Eric Schiffer  chairman of Reputation Management Consultants  a consulting firm  and who has been speaking with people at Facebook   Ten years ago  Facebook was the hottest place to go out of college  This year  the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook  
When Mr  Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer  Mr  Grewal  his absence made headlines 
When he spoke to workers on Wednesday  Mr  Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports  two employees said  Staff members asked questions about how Mr  Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust  especially in light of the  DeleteFacebook campaign from users  the two employees said 
Mr  Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third party quiz app that had obtained access to  large amounts of information  from the social network  which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica  He also said the company would restrict third party developers  access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica 
Of the  DeleteFacebook campaign  Mr  Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview   I think it s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people  and I understand that  
Three Facebook employees said morale had improved following the interviews and the internal communications that Mr  Zuckerberg did on Wednesday  One of them said he had avoided a trip home to see his family last weekend because he did not want to answer questions about the company he worked for 
On Friday  Facebook s senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re evaluate its privacy and security measures  said two employees 
There was a feeling  said one of the people  that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust  And over all  he said  confidence was up 
BRUSSELS    Facebook has confirmed that the data of 2 7 million EU citizens were among those improperly used by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  the EU executive said on Friday 
The European Commission said it received a letter from the social media giant late on Thursday and that it would press for more details  piling pressure on the firm that has lost more than  100 billion in market value in the last 10 days 
 Facebook confirmed to us that the data of overall up to 2 7 million Europeans or people in the EU to be more precise may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica   a Commission spokesman said 
 The letter also explains the steps Facebook has taken in response since

Facebook has had a particularly bad few days  even for a Silicon Valley giant that has been under fire for months  The social network  which was once Silicon Valley s pride and joy  is now facing a new scandal over data privacy   and the fallout has been intense and keeps widening 
Let s recap how it all unfolded 
Over the weekend  The New York Times  along with The Observer of London and The Guardian  broke the news that a British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users and used it to target messages to potential American voters 
The revelations set off an immediate hue and cry  American and British lawmakers demanded that Facebook explain how the data had been harvested without people being alerted  Senator Amy Klobuchar  a Democrat from Minnesota  pressed Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before lawmakers in person  Others have since piled on 
On Monday  The Times reported that Facebook s executive in charge of information security  Alex Stamos  was planning to leave the social network by August  The move reflected heightened internal tensions at the top of the company  showing how the scrutiny has taken a toll 
Criticism of Facebook intensified on Tuesday  Wall Street investors sold off the company s shares  with a nearly 7 percent drop on Monday and a 2 5 percent fall on Tuesday  To top it off  the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement on data privacy  sparked by the Cambridge Analytica reports 
Where have Mr  Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders been in all of this  you may ask  Good question  The top brass at the company s headquarters in Menlo Park have been silent for days

The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things  but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system   atmospheric river  and  Pineapple Express  
So which one is it 
 Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast   said Marty Ralph  a research meteorologist affiliated with U C  San Diego s Scripps Institution of Oceanography   About 15 years ago we recognized that there s a broader definition called an atmospheric river  and those happen all over the planet  
For non scientists  atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually 
 If you look from space from a satellite  it does look like a sinuous river   said Daniel Swain  a climate scientist at U C L A   It s a colorful term  and it s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process  
But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers  not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms 
The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands  hence the playful  Pineapple Express   Not everyone agrees  though  that this storm falls under that category 
 I wouldn t call this one a Pineapple Express  The storm is coming from the West  but the tail of this atmospheric river didn t come from Hawaii  it came from east of Hawaii   Mr  Ralph said   But I m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this  The modern term is atmospheric river  
Nomenclature aside  Mr  Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue  Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard  it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County  The forecast is severe  and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides 
 The forecast is for a really  really big rain   he said   Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity  Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict

 At the same time  though  it s our responsibility to be vigilant   he said   In the year 2018  you have to assume everything you click online  everything you watch  every website you visit will be collecting data on you   and that data will be used eventually to try to sell you something

NEW YORK    Facebook revealed Wednesday that tens of millions more people might have been exposed in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal than previously thought and said it will restrict the user data that outsiders can access 
Those developments came as congressional officials said CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify next week  while Facebook unveiled a new privacy policy that aims to explain the data it gathers on users more clearly   but doesn t actually change what it collects and shares 
In a call with reporters Wednesday  Zuckerberg acknowledged he made a  huge mistake  in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook s responsibility is in the world  He said it isn t enough for Facebook to believe app developers when they say they follow the rules  He says Facebook has to ensure they do 
Facebook is facing its worst privacy scandal in years following allegations that Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated data mining firm  used ill gotten data from millions of users through an app to try to influence elections 
Facebook said Wednesday that as many as 87 million people might have had their data accessed   an increase from the 50 million disclosed in published reports  Facebook is basing the estimate in part on the number of friends each user might have had  Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it had data for only 30 million people 
On Monday all Facebook users will receive a notice on their Facebook feeds with a link to see what apps they use and what information they have shared with those apps  They ll have a chance to delete apps they no longer want  Users who might have had their data shared with Cambridge Analytica will be told of that  Facebook says most of the affected users are in the U S 
Zuckerberg said fixing the company s problems will take years 
Besides the privacy scandal  Facebook also has been dealing with fake news  the use of Facebook to spread hate and discord and concerns about social media s effect on people s mental well being 
These are  big issues  and a big shift for Facebook as it broadens its responsibility  Zuckerberg said  He added that he does think that by the end of this year the company will have  turned a corner  on a lot of the issues  Zuckerberg has made fixing the company his personal challenge for 2018 
As part of the steps it s taking to address scrutiny about outsiders  access to user data  Facebook outlined several changes to further tighten its policies  For one  it is restricting access that apps can have to data about users  events  as well as information about groups such as member lists and content 
In addition  the company is also removing the option to search for users by entering a phone number or an email address  While this helped individuals find friends  Facebook says businesses that had phone or email information on customers were able to collect profile information this way  Facebook says it believes most of its 2 2 billion users had their public profile information scraped by businesses or various malicious actors through this technique at some point  Posts and other content set to be visible only to friends weren t collected 
This comes on top of changes announced a few weeks ago  For example  Facebook has said it will remove developers  access to people s data if the person has not used the app in three months 
Earlier Wednesday  Facebook unveiled a new privacy policy that seeks to clarify its data collection and use 
Although Facebook says the policy changes aren t prompted by recent events or tighter privacy rules coming from the EU  it s an opportune time  Zuckerberg is set to testify April 10 before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees  and a day later before the House Energy and Commerce Committee   The two sessions will be his first testimony before Congress  Separately  the U S  Federal Trade Commission and various authorities in Europe are investigating 
As Facebook evolved from a closed  Harvard only network with no ads to a giant corporation with  40 billion in advertising revenue and huge subsidiaries like Instagram and WhatsApp  its privacy policy has also shifted   over and over 
Almost always  critics say  the changes meant a move away from protecting user privacy toward pushing openness and more sharing  On the other hand  regulatory and user pressure has sometimes led Facebook to pull back on its data collection and use and to explain things in plainer language   in contrast to dense legalese from many other internet companies 
The policy changes come a week after Facebook gave its privacy settings a makeover  The company tried to make it easier to navigate its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings  though the makeover didn t change what Facebook collects and shares either 
Facebook s new privacy policy has a new section explaining that it collects people s contact information if they choose to  upload  sync or import  this to the service  This may include users  address books on their phones  as well as their call logs and text histories  The new policy says Facebook may use this data to help  you and others find people you may know  
Several users were surprised to learn recently that Facebook had been collecting information about whom they texted or called and for how long  though not the actual contents of text messages  It seemed to have been done without explicit consent  though Facebook says it collected such data only from Android users who specifically allowed it to do so   for instance  by agreeing to permissions when installing Facebook 
On Wednesday  Facebook said will delete all logs after a year and in the future  the only information this tool will collect from now on is the data that it needs to operate and  not broader data such as the time of calls  
The new policy also makes it clear that WhatsApp and Instagram are part of Facebook and that the companies share information about users  WhatsApp will still have a separate policy as well  while Facebook and Instagram share one 
___
This story has been corrected to reflect that WhatsApp has its own privacy policy  while Facebook and Instagram share the same one 
Debates over privacy have plagued Facebook for years 
But the news that  Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm that worked on President Trump s 2016 campaign  was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked an unusually strong reaction among its users 
The hashtag  DeleteFacebook appeared more than 10 000 times on Twitter within a two hour period on Wednesday  according to the analytics service ExportTweet  On Tuesday  it was mentioned 40 398 times  according to the analytics service Digimind 
Cher was one such deserter  writing on Twitter that the decision to quit Facebook  although  very hard   was necessary because she loves the United States 
Brian Acton  a co founder of the WhatsApp messaging service  told his tens of thousands of followers on Tuesday to delete Facebook  The social network acquired WhatsApp in a  19 billion deal in 2014 
For people who aren t celebrities or billionaires  the decision to abandon Facebook came reluctantly  because the platform often served as their sole connection to certain relatives  friends and professional opportunities 
Here  some newly Facebook free users of social media discuss why they left 
______
Richard H  Perry
A filmmaker in Los Angeles
For a long time now  Mr  Perry had wanted to leave Facebook 
He never felt comfortable knowing that the company had access to much of his personal information  In the months before the 2016 presidential election  he watched the social network become what he called  a garbage platform of ads and weird reposted articles and people that you care about exposing themselves as racists  
But Facebook was also where Mr  Perry promoted his films  where he posted ads seeking help on the set  and where he communicated with colleagues and a  massive number  of his friends and relatives 
Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica 
 I suspected this stuff was going on  but this is the first time it s been plainly exposed   he said   It seems so malicious  and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down  like it doesn t care about its users  
Mr  Perry  39  has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs 
 It was an easy decision   he said   It s not going to be the end of the world  
______
Dan Clark
A retired Navy veteran in Maine
Mr  Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide  This week  he deleted both 
 Facebook was the main platform I used to keep in touch with all of them  and it was a difficult decision to give it up   he said   But you have to stand for something  so I just put my foot down and said enough is enough  
Mr  Clark  57  said he had already been angry with Facebook for censoring some of his posts  which he said expressed his staunchly conservative views but were  never evil or putting anybody down   He could not abide the idea that his personal information was also being sold or given away without his consent 
Before cutting the cord  Mr  Clark posted on Facebook inviting his contacts to ask him for his personal phone number  More than 100 people reached out within three days 
 There are just so many ways nowadays to stay in contact  phones  email  instant message  Gab  which is a social network that doesn t censor anything   he said   Facebook is more obsolete than people would think  
______
Alexandra Kleeman
A writer on Staten Island
Her first experience with fake news   a Facebook post claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr  Trump s candidacy   altered the way Ms  Kleeman looked at Facebook 
 It changed the psychological and emotional feel of the platform for me   she said   I don t have a great feeling when I log in  
The Cambridge Analytica scandal led her to remove the Facebook app from her phone   I m not going to give them my engagement clicks   Ms  Kleeman  32  said  But she is keeping the messaging function open for professional purposes and will continue using Instagram 
She doesn t mind the idea that some personal data can be made public   she used to have a blog  she said 
 But the idea that my data could be used for purposes that I expressly don t want  that freaks me out  
______
Paul Musgrave
An assistant professor in Amherst  Mass 
Twitter makes Mr  Musgrave feel depressed about the world  but Facebook is the social media platform he is trying to abandon 
As a political science teacher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  Mr  Musgrave  36  feels a professional responsibility to keep abreast of the news and academic chatter hurtling at him in the form of tweets 
Facebook was more valuable to him as a  low key  offstage networking tool   a  replacement for end of year family newsletters  that allowed him to  passively keep up with people   he said  He joined the platform more than a decade ago and before that had been a member of Friendster  a precursor to Facebook 
But in 2016  while helping his mother during her campaign for a government position in Indiana  Mr  Musgrave discovered a  poisonous swamp  of content on the site  The Cambridge Analytica findings were even more disturbing  he said 
 This is a company that has Orwellian levels of data about us  truly Big Brother level  but it s behaving as if it has no social responsibility and is a purely neutral medium of communication   he said   That s what s really been scary  
Having deactivated his Facebook account  with plans to delete it  he now worries about connecting with people who use the social network as their main conduit of communication 
 I m definitely pruning myself away from some of those really important branches   he said   I watch my own students try to navigate the world of apps and smartphones  and even they don t really know how the internet works outside these enclosed garden spaces

Ben Greenzweig
An entrepreneur in Westchester  N Y 
Once Mr  Greenzweig confirms that the 1 195 photos and 85 videos in his Facebook profile have downloaded  he plans to delete the account he has maintained for nearly a decade 
Mr  Greenzweig  40  said the Cambridge Analytica news was  the last straw  
 We have surpassed the tipping point  where the benefit now fails to outweigh the cost   he said   But I will definitely miss what the promise of Facebook used to be   a way to connect to community in a very global and local context  
A year ago  Mr  Greenzweig was an  extraordinarily active  Facebook user who juggled conversations with friends  managed several groups  took out ads for his business and maintained professional contacts 
But on Tuesday night  in his final post  he asked his network to connect with him through email  LinkedIn  Twitter or phone 
 See everyone in the real world   he wrote 
WASHINGTON    Investigators on two congressional panels are looking into whether Russia acquired the data of millions of Facebook users and if companies with ties to then 2016 Republican election candidate Donald Trump s campaign played any role in providing it  three sources familiar with the inquiries said 
On Tuesday  Facebook said it had deleted 70 Facebook accounts  138 Facebook pages and 65 Instagram accounts that it said were  controlled  by the Internet Research Agency  IRA   a Russian propaganda arm based in St  Petersburg 
Last September  Facebook disclosed that it had suspended about 470  inauthentic accounts  that it believed were  likely operated out of Russia  and had purchased 3 000 ads which  appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages  
And on Wednesday  the social media platform said the personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify on April 10 and 11 to Congress 
In an indictment in February  Robert Mueller  the special counsel investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential campaign  charged IRA and 13 Russians with conspiring to interfere in U S  politics and elections  Moscow denies tampering in U S  elections and President Trump denies any coordination between his campaign and Russian officials 
Among the issues investigators on the U S  Senate Intelligence Committee and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are digging into are whether IRA and other Russian organizations used any Facebook data  the sources said  speaking on condition of anonymity  Also  whether the use of such data had any impact on the U S  election  and how much Facebook data may have been acquired by Russian entities  the sources said 
Zuckerberg last month disclosed that in 2013  Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan  who ran a company called Global Science Research  GSR   created a personality quiz app that was installed by about 300 000 Facebook users 
Zuckerberg said that because of the way the Facebook platform worked at the time  this gave Kogan access to data of  tens of millions  of friends of users who took the quiz 
On Wednesday  Mike Schroepfer  Facebook s Chief Technology Officer  acknowledged in a public posting that  the Facebook information of up to 87 million people   mostly in the US   may have been improperly shared  with Cambridge Analytica 
Zuckerberg said Facebook learned in 2015 that Kogan shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica  The London based consulting firm received millions of dollars from the Trump campaign and a political action committee supported by financier Robert Mercer  who supported Trump  Zuckerberg said Kogan  misused  Facebook s data 
Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Wednesday that it  did not use any  data it acquired from Kogan s company in work related to the 2016 U S  presidential campaign  The firm added that it took legal action against GSR  and that it  immediately deleted the raw data  from its server when it learned from Facebook that the data had been  improperly obtained  
Representative Adam Schiff  the House intelligence committee s top Democrat  sent Kogan a letter requesting correspondence and message traffic on his dealings with Cambridge Analytica and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon  any material related to Russia  and that Kogan agree to an interview 
Kogan said in an email to Reuters that he knows nothing about Facebook data being obtained by Russia and had never heard of the Internet Research Agency  until a few weeks ago

JAKARTA    Indonesia s communication ministry said it has asked Facebook Inc to confirm whether personal data from any of its citizens was shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica and is coordinating with police in case any laws were breached 
Facebook said this week that the personal information of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica 
The social media giant has said most of the users appeared to be in the United States  but there have been reports that they included data from more than one million Indonesians 
 There is an indication that Indonesian Facebook users are part of Cambridge Analytica s data case  We are requesting an exact figure   Communications Minister Rudiantara said in a statement sent to Reuters by text message 
The minister said he had also sought reassurances from Facebook that it was complying with an Indonesian government decree on private data protection and a law on electronic information and transactions 
Breaches of the law can include criminal sanctions with a maximum penalty of up to 12 years in jail or a fine of 12 billion rupiah   870 000  
Asked for comment  Facebook said in an emailed statement   We are strongly committed to protecting people s information  and we intend to make all the same privacy controls and settings available everywhere  
The company had taken  significant steps to make our privacy tools easier to find  restrict data access on Facebook  and make our Terms and Data Policy clearer   it said 
Facebook would  continue to work with privacy and information commissioners  and authorities  in Indonesia  
The communications ministry said it was coordinating with Indonesia s National Police in case there was a need to take law enforcement action 
National police spokesman Setyo Wasisto confirmed this 
Indonesia had 69 million monthly active Facebook users as of the first quarter of 2014  ranking the country fourth globally after the United States  India and Brazil  company data showed 
Indonesia threatened last year to block Facebook s WhatsApp Messenger  which is widely used in the country  unless obscene Graphics Interchange Format  GIF  images provided by third parties were removed 
Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that the social network had not seen any meaningful impact on usage or ad sales in the wake of a data privacy scandal

President Trump s tariff salvo  fewer weapons inside Ukraine s Parliament and a pile of ocean garbage larger than France  Here s what you need to know 
  The Trump administration said it would exempt the European Union and other allies from stiff steel and aluminum tariffs that go into effect today  but in a twist  the administration may impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States 
The move came as President Trump announced plans to impose about  60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports  in punishment for what the White House says is China s pattern of co opting American tech and trade secrets 
China hit back Friday morning  proposing reciprocal tariffs on  3 billion of American made imports  and said that it would also pursue legal action against the U S  at the World Trade Organization

Every day  we spend hours poring over correspondents  dispatches and news reports from across Europe  from Iceland to Turkey 
In conversations with editors  we seek to distill wider trends from the day to day politics and give you what you need to know to start your day 
Of course  the result has often been a compromise  Is it flawed  Always 
But that s the rule for all early drafts of history 
My last briefing is today s  I d like to invite you to keep reading  keep debating and keep challenging assumptions  Thank you for your time  Now enjoy your morning coffee

As Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism  even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries 
Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week  as a creator of one of Facebook s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant 
 It is time   deletefacebook   wrote Brian Acton  one of the founders of WhatsApp  wrote on Twitter  His company was bought by Facebook for  19 billion in 2014  The deal made him a billionaire 
Mr  Acton s anti Facebook message  retweeted more than 10 000 times  captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best known people are publicly calling for change  The chorus has grown louder this week  as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  to obtain data on 50 million users 
 The question is   What are you loyal to    said Tristan Harris  a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology  an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture  He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions 
 Are you more loyal to your company   Mr  Harris said   Or are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society  
The tech defections have accelerated in recent months  especially for Facebook 
Justin Rosenstein  the creator of the Facebook  like  button  deleted the product from his phone and spoke out about the industry using psychologically manipulative advertising  Chamath Palihapitiya  Facebook s former head of user growth  said in December that the company was  ripping apart the social fabric of how society works   And Sandy Parakilas  a former Facebook platform operations manager  wrote on Tuesday in The Washington Post that Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  must  be held accountable for the negligence of his company  
Loyalty to a company is beginning to crack because many tech workers are being asked to build or defend products they question  Mr  Harris said  His center is making resources for engineers on how to build more ethical products and starting an educational campaign  called  The Truth About Tech   in 55 000 American schools 
 More people are speaking up because they feel like they ve been told lies   Mr  Harris said   You can t just repeat   We re making the world more open  over and over and over again while democracy is burning  
Silicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers  who often exercise  play sports and eat three meals a day together  Facebook especially is known for its tight knit community  Each employee has an annual  Faceversary  on his or her hire date  a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons 
 Until very recently  it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength   said Leslie Berlin  the author of Troublemakers  a history of Silicon Valley 
She said the defections she sees now are historically unique 
 The Valley was founded on this notion of   We re very open     Ms  Berlin said   But the secrecy has always been there  
 It s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now   she said   This is something new  
Employees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley s success  both technologically and financially  The technology platforms have become more powerful   and the fortunes much bigger   than the programmers ever expected  So while the industry s power disturbs them  the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution  Ms  Berlin said 
 It s the shadow of the success   she said   You have to understand them together  
Certainly  not everyone is critical  Mr  Acton s WhatsApp co founder  Jan Koum  is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform  regularly posting pro President Trump and anti immigration news 
And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook  the company has often responded aggressively 
 They do yell   said Roger McNamee  an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg  referring to Facebook leadership s approach 
But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore  he said 
 Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on   Mr  McNamee said   The facts are not only indisputable  they re not even complete  It s going to get worse  
NEW YORK    Facebook s acknowledgement that most of its 2 2 billion members have probably had their personal data scraped by  malicious actors  is the latest example of the social network s failure to protect its users  data 
Not to mention its apparent inability to even identify the problem until the company was already embroiled in scandal 
CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters Wednesday that Facebook is shutting down a feature that let people search for Facebook users by phone number or email address  Although that was useful for people who wanted to find others on Facebook  it turns out that unscrupulous types also figured out years ago that they could use it to identify individuals and collect data off their profiles 
The scrapers were at it long enough  Zuckerberg said  that  at some point during the last several years  someone has probably accessed your public information in this way  
The only way to be safe would have been for users to deliberately turn off that search feature several years ago  Facebook had it turned on by default 
 I think Facebook has not been clear enough with how to use its privacy settings   said Jamie Winterton  director of strategy for Arizona State University s Global Security Initiative   That  to me  was the failure  
The breach was a stunning admission for a company already reeling from allegations that the political data mining firm Cambridge Analytica inappropriately accessed data on as many as 87 million Facebook users to influence elections 
Over the past few weeks  the scandal has mushroomed into investigations across continents  including a probe by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  Zuckerberg himself will be questioned by Congress for the first time on Tuesday 
 The FTC looked the other way for years when consumer groups told them Facebook was violating its 2011 deal to better protect its users  But now the Cambridge Analytica scandal has awoken the FTC from its long digital privacy slumber   said Jeffrey Chester  executive director for the Washington based privacy nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy 
Neither Zuckerberg nor his company has identified those who carried out the data scraping  Outside experts believe they could have been identity thieves  scam artists or shady data brokers assembling marketing profiles 
Zuckerberg said the company detected the problem in a data privacy audit started after the Cambridge Analytica disclosures  but didn t say why the company hadn t noticed it   or fixed it   earlier 
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on when it discovered the data scraping 
In his call with reporters Wednesday  Zuckerberg said the company had tried  rate limiting  the searches  This restricted how many searches someone can conduct at one time from a particular IP address  a numeric designation that identifies a device s location on the internet  But Zuckerberg said the scrapers circumvented that defense by cycling through multiple IP addresses 
The scraped information was limited to what a user had already chosen to make public   which  depending on a person s privacy settings  could be a lot   as well as what Facebook requires people to share  That includes full name  profile picture and listings of school or workplace networks 
But hackers and scam artists could then use that information   and combine it with other data in circulation   to pull hoaxes on people  plant malware on their computers or commit other mischief 
Having access to such a massive amount of data could also pose national security risks  Winterton said 
A foreign entity could conceivably use such information to influence elections or stir up discord   exactly what Russia is alleged to have done  using Facebook and other social media  in the 2016 presidential elections 
Privacy advocates have long been critical of Facebook s penchant for pushing people to share more and more information  often through pro sharing default options 
While the company offers detailed privacy controls   users can turn off ad targeting  for example  or face recognition  and post updates that no one else sees   many people never change their settings  and often don t even know how to 
The company has tried to simplify its settings multiple times over the years  most recently this week 
Winterton said that for individual Facebook users  worrying about this data scraping won t do much good   after all  the data is already out there  But she said it might be a good time to  reflect on what we are sharing and how we are sharing it and whether we need to  
 Just because someone asks us information  it doesn t mean we have to give it to them if we are not comfortable   she said 
She added that while she no longer has a Facebook account  when she did she put her birth year as 1912 and her hometown as Kuala Lumpur  Malaysia  Neither is true

Mr  Bolton s political committee  known as The John Bolton Super PAC  first hired Cambridge in August 2014  months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data 
In the two years that followed  Mr  Bolton s super PAC spent nearly  1 2 million primarily for  survey research   which is a term that campaigns use for polling  according to campaign finance records 
But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge  a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  offers more detail on just what Mr  Bolton was buying  The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as  behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging  
To do that work  Cambridge used Facebook data  according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work 
 The data and modeling Bolton s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica   We definitely told them about how we were doing it  We talked about it in conference calls  in meetings  
Cambridge Analytica  which rose to prominence through its work with Mr  Trump s 2016 election campaign  has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters 
Cambridge s so called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned its work for Mr  Trump s campaign in 2016  setting off a furious   and still unsettled   debate about whether the firm s technology worked  The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr  Bolton s super PAC 
 The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues   Mr  Wylie said 
 That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview   he added   That s what they said they wanted  anyway  
Using the psychographic models  Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr  Bolton s PAC  including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis  the Republican senator from North Carolina  according to Mr  Wylie and another former employee  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge 
One advertisement  a video that was posted on YouTube  was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness  and were thought to respect hard work and experience  It emphasized Mr  Bolton s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr  Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president 
Beyond their conservative politics  Mr  Trump  Mr  Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron   the Mercer family of Long Island  whose patriarch  Robert L  Mercer  made a fortune at the helm of a top yielding hedge fund 
Cambridge Analytica  which grew out of the London based SCL Group  was founded in 2014 with a  15 million investment from Mr  Mercer  whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm s board of directors  Stephen K  Bannon was also a co founder 
At the same time  Mr  Mercer was financially supporting Mr  Bolton s PAC  donating  5 million between April 2014 and September 2016  according to Federal Election Commission filings  The Mercers also backed Mr  Trump in the presidential election 
The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer 
The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook  and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica 
The company also suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections 
But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge  and Mr  Bolton s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns  including Mr  Trump s 
The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data  Staff from SCL s elections division  which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge  discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC  according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times 
The profiles would be used to  identify the personality traits of individuals  in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC  said the agenda  which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff   Individuals can be targeted with the right message   it said 
The agenda also included a line  in boldfaced text  that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton s campaign to direct people  toward the FB app   Cambridge  working through an outside researcher  used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network s profiles  The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research  and users were not aware of its true purpose 
Months later  the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr  Bolton  In an email dated Oct  1  2014  Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr  Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC 
 It s not just about how much you spend  It s also about how smart you spend   the email advised Mr  Bolton to say 
 One way we re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm    Cambridge Analytica    to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters   it continued   We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile  So if you re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about  our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her

  President Trump believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on his instincts rather than on the people who work for him  according to his friends and advisers 
That self confidence surfaced over the weekend as Mr  Trump abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 election  He criticized Robert Mueller and what he characterized as a partisan investigation  leading some Republicans to warn him against shutting down the inquiry 
The president also renewed attacks against former officials at the F B I   including  lying James Comey  and Andrew McCabe  whose firing Mr  Trump called  a great day for Democracy  
  Unusually  they responded in kind   Mr  President  the American people will hear my story very soon   Mr  Comey wrote on Twitter  apparently referring to his upcoming book  Others used far harsher language 
  Ever taken a quiz on Facebook 
The social network is again defending its protection of user information after a political data firm harvested private information from more than 50 million profiles  The data was obtained in 2014  when users were paid to take a personality quiz and download an app that scraped information from their profiles and those of their friends 
Lawmakers in the U S  and Britain are calling for greater scrutiny after a joint examination published over the weekend by The New York Times and The Observer of London  The report explained how the firm  Cambridge Analytica  developed voter profiling techniques that were used in Donald Trump s presidential campaign 
  Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested  and the lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states

SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON    Facebook Inc backed for the first time on Friday proposed legislation requiring social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads and introduced a new verification process for people buying  issue  ads  which have been used to sow discord online 
The change in stance  announced in a Facebook post by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg  comes a few days before he is scheduled to answer questions in congressional hearings about how the company handles its users  data 
The steps are designed to deter the kind of election meddling and online information warfare that U S  authorities have accused Russia of pursuing  Zuckerberg said  Moscow has denied the allegations 
 Election interference is a problem that s bigger than any one platform  and that s why we support the Honest Ads Act   Zuckerberg wrote in his post 
That legislation  introduced last October but not yet passed  is aimed at countering concerns about foreign nationals using social media to influence American politics  which is part of the investigation into possible Russian meddling during the 2016 U S  presidential campaign 
Zuckerberg said that he also wanted to shed more light on  issue ads   or ads that discuss a political subject such as gun laws or racism but do not directly relate to an election or a candidacy  and would require every such advertiser to confirm their identity and location 
 Any advertiser who doesn t pass will be prohibited from running political or issue ads   Zuckerberg wrote 
Facebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names had used the social network to try to influence U S  voters in the months before and after the 2016 election  writing about inflammatory subjects  setting up events and buying ads 
In February  U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies with interfering in the election by sowing discord on social media 
The requirement to verify the identity of such ad buyers was important to counter activity by organizations such as Russia s Internet Research Agency  a so called online  troll farm   said Democratic Senator Mark Warner  a sponsor of the Honest Ads Act 
 Most of the paid ads the Internet Research Agency ran on Facebook prior to the 2016 election didn t mention Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump   but they did mention divisive political issues like guns  LGBT rights  immigration  and racial issues   Warner said in a statement 
UPHILL FIGHT
The Honest Ads Act would expand existing election law covering television and radio outlets to apply to paid internet and digital advertisements on platforms like Facebook  Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc s Google 
Google declined comment  Twitter could not immediately be reached for comment 
Facebook had previously stopped short of backing the legislation  saying it wanted to work with lawmakers further and announcing attempts at self regulation 
The bill s sponsors said they welcomed Facebook s support  They have faced an uphill fight so far because Republicans  who are generally sceptical of political ad regulations  have majorities in the House and Senate 
The Senate legislation has one Republican sponsor  Senator John McCain 
Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear on Tuesday before a joint hearing of two U S  Senate committees  and on Wednesday before a U S  House committee 
Under the Honest Ads Act  digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly views would need to maintain a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by anyone spending more than  500 
The legislation would also require online platforms to make  all reasonable efforts  to ensure that foreign nationals and entities are not buying political ads to influence the U S  electorate 
Facebook will also require verification of people who manage Facebook pages with large followings  Zuckerberg wrote

SAN FRANCISCO    Three Facebook Messenger app users have filed a lawsuit claiming the social network violated their privacy by collecting logs of their phone calls and text messages 
The suit  filed Tuesday in federal court in northern California  comes as Facebook faces scrutiny over privacy concerns 
Facebook acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google s Android system in 2015  Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected  that it didn t collect the contents of messages or calls  and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings 
The suit seeks class action status 
A message seeking comment from Facebook on Wednesday was not immediately returned 
SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday that he agreed  in spirit  with a strict new European Union law on data privacy but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world 
As Facebook reels from a scandal over the mishandling of personal information belonging to millions of users  the company is facing demands to improve privacy and learn lessons from the landmark EU law scheduled to take effect next month 
Zuckerberg told Reuters in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally  bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide  but the 33 year old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide 
 We re still nailing down details on this  but it should directionally be  in spirit  the whole thing   Zuckerberg said  He did not elaborate 
His comments signal that U S  Facebook users  many of them still angry over the company s admission that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica got hold of Facebook data on 50 million members  could find themselves in a worse position than Europeans 
The European law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet  giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted 
Apple Inc and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain 
Shares of Facebook closed up 0 5 percent on Tuesday at  156 11   110 8   They are down more than 15 percent since March 16  when the scandal broke over Cambridge Analytica 
PUSH FOR DATA PRIVACY
Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc s Google to apply EU data laws worldwide  largely without success 
 We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe   said Jeff Chester  executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  in Washington 
Zuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law  such as the ability of users to delete all their data  are already available for people on Facebook 
 We think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world   he said   The vast majority of what is required here are things that we ve already had for years across the world for everyone  
Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue  Both based in California  they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people 
Google has declined to comment on its plans 
When GDPR takes effect on May 25  people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks  for example  Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people s data  and they will need to get explicit consent 
GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law 
Data is central to Facebook s advertising business  and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply  said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser 
 I haven t heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet   Wieser said 
Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue 
It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place  said Nicole Ozer  director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California 
Companies  promises are less reassuring than laws  she said   If user privacy is going to be properly protected  the law has to require it

WASHINGTON    Facebook isn t just a company  It s a behemoth  with 2 1 billion monthly users   40 billion in revenue and more than 25 000 employees worldwide 
And that leaves Washington with a daunting task  How do you tame a corporate giant  Or do you even try 
 It s tricky and it s going to be hard  but there are ways it can be dealt with   says Virginia Sen  Mark Warner  a former tech executive who has led investigations into Russian interference on social media over the last year as the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee   The idea that we re going to keep the wild  wild West   I don t think it s sustainable  
The picture will begin to come into focus next week  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify April 10 and 11 before Senate and House committees as his company grapples with the privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica  a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump 
Facebook s reckoning in Washington comes on multiple fronts  Russia s use of the platform to meddle in U S  elections  a regulatory investigation that could result in fines of hundreds of millions of dollars against the company for privacy violations  and the Cambridge Analytica episode are all topmost concerns 
But in the capital s pro business  anti regulatory climate  it s questionable whether the Republican led Congress or Trump regulators have the appetite to rein it in 
Facebook is spending millions on lobbying to try to ward off regulations  even seeking to narrow a Senate bill that lawmakers call  the lightest touch possible   It would require more transparency in online political ads  something Facebook says it is providing on its own 
But the stakes grew Wednesday when Facebook revealed that information belonging to as many as 87 million of its users may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica  which gathered the data with the intent of swaying elections  That number was far higher than originally known 
Congress  response to the myriad issues dogging Facebook could depend on Zuckerberg himself  He has apologized for a  major breach of trust  in the Cambridge Analytica episode and Facebook has announced it would stop working with third party data collectors 
Privacy advocates and legal experts say that s not enough 
 It strikes me as a company that is trying to weather a PR storm and then get back to business as usual and hoping their users forget this ever happened   said Nate Cardozo  a senior staff attorney for Electronic Frontier Foundation  a privacy group based in San Francisco 
Facebook and other social media companies have faced bipartisan criticism over both privacy issues and the Russian intervention  But Trump and his pro business GOP allies on Capitol Hill have made rolling back Obama era regulations a priority  which makes any new federal rules for protecting data and privacy unlikely in the immediate future 
Republicans last year struck down online privacy regulations issued during President Barack Obama s final months in office that would have given consumers more control over how companies like Comcast  AT T and Verizon share information  Critics complained that the rule would have increased costs  stifled innovation and picked winners and losers among internet companies 
And Congress elected to do nothing after Equifax disclosed in September that hackers exploited a software flaw that the credit monitoring company failed to fix  exposing Social Security numbers  birthdates and other personal data belonging to nearly 148 million Americans 
Lawmakers have yet to come up with a fix for the patchwork of conflicting state laws that govern how companies shield personal data and notify consumers when breaches occur  Mike Litt  consumer campaign director at U S  PIRG  a public interest group  said Congress instead is considering legislation that would exempt credit bureaus from data break notifications and make it harder for states to hold them accountable 
 After the Equifax data breach  we saw Congress talk a good game but fail to follow through on helping consumers   Litt said   To prevent Congress from letting Facebook off the hook  outraged Americans need to keep up the heat  
To defend its interests in Washington  Facebook has filled its executive ranks with former senior government officials from both political parties  Nathaniel Gleicher  its director of cybersecurity policy  was in charge of cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council during the Obama administration  Joel Kaplan  Facebook s vice president for global public policy  served as a senior aide to President George W  Bush 
The company spent just over  13 million on lobbying in 2017  according to disclosure records filed with Congress  One of the lobbying team s newer members  Sandra Luff  was Attorney General Jeff Sessions  national security adviser when he served in the Senate 
Zuckerberg suggested during a CNN interview last month that he s open to regulation  But he quickly qualified that commitment  saying he d get behind the  right  kind of rules  such as the bill that requires online political ads to disclose who paid for them  But the company is seeking to weaken even that bill 
Warner acknowledged that even minor regulation of Facebook and other technology companies will be difficult  But he s encouraging them to work with Washington now  before a  catastrophic event  that could shift the landscape or if Democrats win back seats in November s elections 
He suggests several possibilities  requiring Facebook and other companies to disclose the country of origin of ads  creating a self regulatory body  or even allowing users to move their data from one platform to another 
More drastic measures could be to allow users to own their own data or to hold social media companies more responsible for what is posted on their platforms 
In Europe  Facebook and other tech giants like Google are bracing for tough new data privacy rules that take effect May 25 and will apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based  The rules will make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data 
In the U S   Facebook s biggest challenge may come from the Federal Trade Commission  which is investigating whether the company violated the terms of a 2011 settlement that made privacy assurances 
Facebook agreed then to settle the commission s charges that it deceived users by assuring them their information would remain private  then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public  Each violation of the agreement could carry a penalty of up to  40 000  according to settlement terms  meaning potential fines in the hundreds of millions 
Frank Pasquale  a University of Maryland law professor who s written extensively about how corporations use personal data  said the federal government s antitrust enforcers should be more vigilant with Facebook 
Facebook has completed dozens of mergers and acquisitions since it was founded in 2004  Pasquale said the Obama administration failed to realize the significance of two of Facebook s largest purchases  the photo sharing app Instagram for  1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp two years later for nearly  22 billion 
 This is clearly a monopolistic company that is trying to eliminate even the smallest challenge to its domination of the social media market   he said 
The privacy scandal has taken a heavy financial toll on Zuckerberg and Facebook  Forbes Magazine estimated that Zuckerberg s net worth dropped over the last month from  71 billion to  61 7 billion  Facebook s market value has fallen by more than  88 billion in less than three weeks since the scandal broke  from nearly  538 billion in mid March to about  449 5 billion

Associated Press writer Marley Jay in New York contributed to this report 
SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday that he agreed  in spirit  with a strict new European Union law on data privacy but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world 
As Facebook reels from a scandal over the mishandling of personal information belonging to millions of users  the company is facing demands to improve privacy and learn lessons from the landmark EU law scheduled to take effect next month 
Zuckerberg told Reuters in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally  bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide  but the 33 year old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide 
 We re still nailing down details on this  but it should directionally be  in spirit  the whole thing   Zuckerberg said  He did not elaborate 
His comments signal that U S  Facebook users  many of them still angry over the company s admission that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica got hold of Facebook data on 50 million members  could find themselves in a worse position than Europeans 
The European law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet  giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted 
Apple Inc and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain 
Shares of Facebook closed up 0 5 percent on Tuesday at  156 11  They are down more than 15 percent since March 16  when the scandal broke over Cambridge Analytica 
PUSH FOR DATA PRIVACY
Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc s Google to apply EU data laws worldwide  largely without success 
 We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe   said Jeff Chester  executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  in Washington 
Zuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law  such as the ability of users to delete all their data  are already available for people on Facebook 
 We think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world   he said   The vast majority of what is required here are things that we ve already had for years across the world for everyone  
Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue  Both based in California  they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people 
Google has declined to comment on its plans 
When GDPR takes effect on May 25  people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks  for example  Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people s data  and they will need to get explicit consent 
GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law 
Data is central to Facebook s advertising business  and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply  said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser 
 I haven t heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet   Wieser said 
Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue 
It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place  said Nicole Ozer  director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California 
Companies  promises are less reassuring than laws  she said   If user privacy is going to be properly protected  the law has to require it

Since these briefings  inception over a year ago  this has been the question I have been asked the most 
 How do you know what Europeans want to read  
That s a fair question for a journalist  albeit a European one  who has spent most of his adult life in Asia  and still is there 
It is also a legitimate question for a U S  newspaper at a time in which American news cycles are focused on the twists and turns of a tumultuous presidency 
So  here s what we do 
Every day  we spend hours poring over correspondents  dispatches and news reports from across Europe  from Northern Ireland to Turkey 
In conversations with editors  we seek to distill wider trends from the day to day politics and give you what you need to know to start your day 
Of course  the result has often been a compromise  Is it flawed  Always 
But that s the rule for all early drafts of history 
My last briefing is tomorrow s  but I d like to invite you to keep reading  keep debating and keep challenging assumptions  Thank you for your time  Now enjoy your morning coffee

 Reuters    Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network  a step that follows a scandal over how Facebook handles personal information 
The world s largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica 
Facebook adjusted the privacy settings on its service on Wednesday  giving users control over their personal information in fewer taps 
Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom Corp and Experian PLC 
The tool has been widely used among certain categories of advertisers   such as automakers  luxury goods producers and consumer packaged goods companies   who do not sell directly to consumers and have relatively little information about who their customers are  according to Facebook 
 While this is common industry practice  we believe this step  winding down over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook   Graham Mudd  a Facebook product marketing director  said in a statement 
Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to  25 after Facebook s announcement after the bell  Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged 
Acxiom said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March      The company currently expects revenue in the range of  910 million to  915 million in the 2018 fiscal year 
However  for the 2019 fiscal year  Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be negatively impacted by as much as  25 million 
Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue 
Advertisers would still be able to use third party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data  Facebook said 
Facebook s website lists nine third party data providers that it has worked with  including Acxiom  Experian  Oracle Data Cloud  TransUnion and WPP PLC 
Other companies  besides Acxiom  were not available for comment 
Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third party apps from using personal information  Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens  Facebook said 
Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users  anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation 
Facebook s shares closed up 0 5 percent at  153 03 on Wednesday  They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16  when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third party app to Cambridge Analytica  which was later hired by Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign 
The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers  who are Facebook s lifeblood  and lead to tougher regulation 
SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers  access to user information 
There is a new Facebook page   called Access Your Information   where users can see what they have shared and manage it 
 The biggest difference is ease of access in settings  which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users   Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said 
It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers 
They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May  It requires companies to give people a  right to portability    to take their data with them   and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law 
Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users  data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica 
He plans to testify before Congress  a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday  Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators 
Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy  The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing 
The U S  Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook  and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened

SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook is expanding its response to people using the platform improperly and on Tuesday said it had deleted hundreds of Russian accounts and pages associated with a  troll factory  indicted by U S  prosecutors for fake activist and political posts in the 2016 U S  election campaign 
Facebook said many of the deleted articles and pages came from Russia based Federal News Agency  known as FAN  and that the social media company s security team had concluded that the agency was technologically and structurally intertwined with the St  Petersburg based Internet Research Agency 
Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in an exclusive interview that the agency  has repeatedly acted to deceive people and manipulate people around the world  and we don t want them on Facebook anywhere  
The world s largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  which worked on then Republican candidate Donald Trump s campaign 
The removed accounts and pages were mainly in Russian  and many had little political import  the company said  Previously Facebook focused on taking down fake accounts and accounts spreading fake news 
The new policy will include otherwise legitimate content spread by those same actors  Zuckerberg said 
 It is clear from the evidence that we ve collected that those organizations are controlled and operated by  the Internet Research Agency  he added 
In February  the agency known as IRA was among three firms and 13 Russians indicted by U S  Special Counsel Robert Mueller on charges they conspired to tamper in the presidential campaign and support Trump while disparaging Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton 
Russian media organization RBC last year reported that FAN and IRA once shared the same street address and had other connections  One of the people that it said made decisions at FAN was indicted by Mueller s office  which is investigating U S  intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow tried to undermine the democratic process  Russia denies interfering in the elections 
BAN ACCOUNTS
Facebook disclosed in September that Russians used Facebook to meddle in U S  politics  posting on the social network under false names in the months before and after the 2016 elections 
Zuckerberg said on Tuesday that improved machine learning had helped find connections between the latest posts and IRA  He and Facebook security officials said the company would do the same when they find more legitimate content being pushed out by groups exposed as manipulators 
 We re going to execute and operate under our principles   Zuckerberg said   We don t allow people to have fake accounts  and if you repeatedly try to set up fake accounts to manipulate things  then our policy is to ban all of your accounts  
Zuckerberg said that the standard is high for such retribution toward news organizations and that state owned media by itself was fine 
The company decided to root out as much as it can of IRA  which was involved with posts including sponsoring fake pages that were pro Trump  pro border security and protesting police violence against minorities  among other topics 
The expanded response could provoke a backlash from Russian internet regulators 
Last October  Google followed up on reported connections between FAN and IRA by removing FAN stories from its search index  Media regulator Roskomnadzor asked Google for an explanation  saying that it needed to protect free speech  Google then reinstated FAN  according to reports at the time 
Facebook officials said its accounts and pages in question had 1 million unique followers on Facebook and 500 000 on Instagram  mainly in Russia  Ukraine  and nearby countries such as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan 
Zuckerberg  who founded Facebook in his college dorm room in 2004  personally kept quiet about the Cambridge Analytica data leak for four days before apologizing and outlining steps that he said would help protect personal data 
The 33 year old billionaire plans to testify before U S  lawmakers to explain Facebook s privacy policies  a first for him  a source said last week  although he has so far not committed to doing the same for UK lawmakers 
Britain s data protection authority  the U S  Federal Trade Commission and some 37 U S  state attorneys general are investigating Facebook s handling of personal data 
Zuckerberg initially downplayed Facebook s ability to sway voters  saying days after the U S  elections that it was a  pretty crazy idea  that fake news stories had an influence 
Eventually  though  Facebook s security staff came to the conclusion that the social network was being used by spies and other government agents to covertly spread disinformation among rivals and enemies 
Critics including U S  Senator Mark Warner  the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee  have complained Facebook moved too slowly to investigate and counter information warfare 
Facebook stepped up efforts to shutter fake accounts before  a national election last year in France  and has said it will work with election authorities around the world to try to prevent meddling in politics 
The company  which is now one of the main ways politicians advertise to voters  plans to start a public archive showing all election related ads  how much money was spent on each one  the number of impressions each receives and the demographics of the audience reached 
Facebook is on track to bring that data to U S  voters before congressional elections in November  Zuckerberg said on Tuesday  Facebook plans to send postcards by U S  mail to verify the identities and location of people who want to purchase U S  election related advertising

SAN FRANCISCO    Three users of the Facebook Messenger app sued Facebook on Tuesday  saying the social network violated their privacy by collecting logs of their phone calls and text messages  in the latest legal challenge facing the company 
The U S  lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California seeks status as a class action on behalf of all affected users and asks for unspecified damages 
A Facebook representative could not immediately be reached for comment 
Facebook  which is reeling from a scandal over its handling of personal data  on Sunday acknowledged that it had been logging some users  call and text history but said it had done so only when users of the Android operating system had opted in 
Facebook said on Sunday that it does not collect the content of calls or text messages  and that information is securely stored  The data is not sold to third parties  it said 
Android is owned by Alphabet Inc s Google  which is not named as a defendant in the suit

 While this is common industry practice  we believe this step  winding down over the next six months  will help improve people s privacy on Facebook   Graham Mudd  a Facebook product marketing director  said in a statement 
Shares in Acxiom traded down more than 10 percent to  25 after Facebook s announcement after the bell  Shares in other data brokers were largely unchanged  A representative for Acxiom could not immediately be reached for comment 
Facebook declined to comment on how the change could affect its ad revenue 
Advertisers would still be able to use third party data services to measure how well their ads performed by examining purchasing data  Facebook said 
Facebook s website lists nine third party data providers that it has worked with  including Acxiom  Experian  Oracle Data Cloud  TransUnion and WPP PLC 
None of the companies could immediately be reached for comment 
Facebook on Wednesday also put all its privacy settings on one page and made it easier to stop third party apps from using personal information  Privacy settings had previously been spread over at least 20 screens  Facebook said 
Facebook said in a blog post it had been working on the updates for some time but sped things up to appease users  anger over how the company uses data and as lawmakers around the globe call for regulation 
Facebook s shares closed up 0 5 percent at  153 03 on Wednesday  They are still down more than 17 percent since March 16  when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled in 2014 via a third party app to Cambridge Analytica  which was later hired by Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign 
The data leak has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers  who are Facebook s lifeblood  and lead to tougher regulation 
SCRUTINY FROM LAWMAKERS
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the mistakes the company made and has promised to crack down on abuse of the Facebook platform and restrict developers  access to user information 
There is a new Facebook page   called Access Your Information   where users can see what they have shared and manage it 
 The biggest difference is ease of access in settings  which fulfills Mark Zuckerberg s promise to make the privacy process and permissions more transparent to users   Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said 
It was uncertain whether the changes will satisfy lawmakers 
They were announced ahead of a stringent European Union data law which comes into force in May  It requires companies to give people a  right to portability    to take their data with them   and imposes fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies breaking the law 
Lawmakers in the United States and Britain are still clamoring for Zuckerberg himself to explain how users  data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica 
He plans to testify before Congress  a source briefed on the matter said on Tuesday  Facebook has said it has received invitations to testify and that it is talking to legislators 
Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc have been invited to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy  The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have also asked Zuckerberg to appear at a hearing 
The U S  Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into Facebook  and attorneys representing 37 states are also pressing Zuckerberg to explain what happened

NEW DELHI    India s government has sent a notice to Facebook asking whether the personal data of Indian voters and users has been compromised by U K  based Cambridge Analytica or any other downstream entity 
A similar notice was dispatched to Cambridge Analytica last week following media reports that it had misused data to profile Indians and influence their elections  The government set a Saturday deadline for Cambridge Analytica and April 7 for Facebook to respond to its inquiry 
Facebook is facing unprecedented scrutiny following reports that the data mining firm used ill gotten data from tens of millions of its users to try to influence elections 
India s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement late Wednesday that Facebook has its largest footprint in India in terms of its user base and sought to know  what proactive measures it is taking to ensure the safety  security and privacy of such large user data and to prevent its misuse by any third party  
The governing Bharatiya Janata Party and the main opposition Congress Party have accused each other of utilizing the services of the British company  but denied any link with it  Cambridge Analytica s allegedly unauthorized harvesting of Facebook data and a series of leaks linked to India s biometric database has refocused public attention on digital privacy in the country 
Digital law experts say Indian regulations offered particularly weak safeguards against data breach 
The Indian government s notice to Facebook sought to know  whether Facebook or its related or downstream agencies utilizing Facebook s data have previously been engaged by any entities to manipulate the Indian electoral process  
 If any such downstream entity misused data from Facebook  what is the protection available to the data subject   it asked 
 Reuters    A U S  judge has ordered Facebook Inc to let her review documents it has refused to give the Internal Revenue Service as that agency probes whether the social media company used an Irish unit to slash billions of dollars from its tax bill 
In an order on Tuesday night  U S  Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco said she may review up to 15 of the 153 disputed documents  which Facebook believes are privileged or otherwise confidential  The government may select the documents for her to review 
According to the government  most of the documents concern a decision by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and other Facebook executives to set up an international headquarters in Dublin  Ireland  which occurred in 2010  and the transfer of assets such as worldwide user bases and online platforms there 
Facebook was warned by the IRS in July 2016 that the probe could boost its U S  tax bill by  3 billion to  5 billion  plus interest and penalties  for tax years beginning in 2010  It said last month it has set aside adequate amounts for the probe 
The Menlo Park  California based company declined to comment on Wednesday 
Beeler issued her order amid an unrelated worldwide outcry over Facebook s privacy practices  including the harvesting of user data by the London based Cambridge Analytica research firm that worked on Donald Trump s 2016 U S  presidential campaign 
Facebook said on Dec  12 it would stop booking international revenue in Ireland  and instead have local affiliates book such revenue in countries where it was generated 
In making that change  which it expected to complete by the first half of 2019  Facebook cited a desire to  provide more transparency to governments and policy makers around the world  
The company in 2016 routed 12 6 billion euros  US 15 5 billion  of revenue through Ireland but paid just 30 million euros  US 37 million  of taxes there  published reports said

WELLINGTON    New Zealand s privacy commissioner joined international criticism against Facebook Inc  saying on Wednesday it has broken the law by declining a citizen access to personal information held on the accounts of other users 
In a statement  the commissioner said that after being notified of its complaint  Facebook responded that it did not have to comply with the body s demand for the information 
The commissioner  considers it necessary to publicly identify Facebook in order to highlight its demonstrated unwillingness to comply with the law  and to inform the New Zealand public of Facebook s position   the statement said 
The commissioner s statement said  the social media company said the Privacy Act did not apply to it and it did not have to comply with the Commissioner s request to review the information requested by the complainant  
The commissioner said its powers beyond demanding information were limited 
A spokeswoman for Facebook said the company had investigated the complaint but had not been provided enough detail to fully resolve it 
 We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year s worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticized us for protecting their privacy   she said 
 We scrutinize all requests to disclose personal data  particularly the contents of private messages  and will challenge those that are overly broad   Instead the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data  
Facebook has come into spotlight over the past week over its handling of data from millions of users 
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company s privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U S  and British voters in elections 
Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in U S  President Donald Trump s campaign  and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules

WASHINGTON    The U S  Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited the chief executive officers of Facebook Inc  Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy 
The hearing follows allegations that Cambridge Analytica  a British political consultancy  gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users  prompting the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation 
Senator Charles Grassley  the committee s chairman  said he invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  to testify at the hearing to discuss Facebook s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data  
Facebook is facing pressure from advertisers as the social network struggles with government scrutiny following the allegations  Zuckerberg last week apologized for mistakes that Facebook made in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users 
A Facebook spokesman said the company had received the hearing invitation and was reviewing it  A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment  A spokeswoman for Google parent Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The hearing could be the highest profile appearance by technology companies amid growing calls to regulate the industry 
 The hearing will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection  retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use   Grassley said   It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process  
Last week  the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee formally invited Zuckerberg to testify and the Senate Commerce Committee also invited him to appear  Neither committee has set a date for a hearing 
Facebook executives spent Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol Hill briefing congressional committee staffers  Zuckerberg said last week he would be willing to testify if he is the right person at the company to speak to lawmakers

SAN FRANCISCO LONDON    Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the level of trust people have in Facebook over privacy  as the firm ran advertisements in British and U S  newspapers apologizing to users 
Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U S  privacy laws  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Sunday  while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag  Germany s largest selling Sunday paper  found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy 
Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized for  a breach of trust  in advertisements placed in papers including the Observer in Britain and the New York Times  Washington Post and Wall Street Journal 
 We have a responsibility to protect your information  If we can t  we don t deserve it   said the advertisement  which appeared in plain text on a white background with a tiny Facebook logo 
The world s largest social media network is coming under growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States  and is trying to repair its reputation among users  advertisers  lawmakers and investors 
This follows allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to users  information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U S  President Donald Trump in 2016 
U S  Senator Mark Warner  the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee  said in an interview on NBC s Meet the Press  on Sunday that Facebook had not been  fully forthcoming  over how Cambridge Analytica had used Facebook data 
Warner repeated calls for Zuckerberg to testify in person before U S  lawmakers  saying Facebook and other internet companies had been reluctant to confront  the dark underbelly of social media  and how it can be manipulated 
 BREACH OF TRUST 
Zuckerberg acknowledged that an app built by a university researcher had  leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014  
 This was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time   Zuckerberg said  reiterating an apology first made last week in U S  television interviews 
Facebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week  while the hashtag  DeleteFacebook gained traction online 
The Reuters Ipsos online poll found that 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information  compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon com Inc  62 percent who trust Alphabet Inc s Google  60 percent for Microsoft Corp 
The poll was conducted from Wednesday through Friday and had 2 237 responses   https   reut rs 2G9hvrv 
The German poll published by Bild was conducted by Kantar EMNID  a unit of global advertising holding company WPP  using representative polling methods  the firm said  Overall  only 33 percent found social media had a positive effect on democracy  against 60 percent who believed the opposite 
It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook  eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said in an interview  Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith  she said 
 It s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that s become pretty well ingrained into people s lives   she said 
Data supplied to Reuters by the Israeli firm SimilarWeb  which measures global online audiences  indicated that Facebook usage in major markets and worldwide remained steady over the past week 
 Desktop  mobile and app usage has remained steady and well within the expected range   said Gitit Greenberg  SimilarWeb s director of market insights   It is important to separate frustration from actual tangible impacts to Facebook usage

On the same day Facebook bought ads in U S  and British newspapers to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal  the social media site faced new questions about collecting phone numbers and text messages from Android devices 
The website Ars Technica reported that users who checked data gathered by Facebook on them found that it had years of contact names  telephone numbers  call lengths and text messages 
Facebook said Sunday the information is uploaded to secure servers and comes only from Android users who opt in to allow it  Spokeswomen say the data is not sold or shared with users  friends or outside apps  They say the data is used  to improve people s experience across Facebook  by helping to connect with others 
The company also says in a website posting that it does not collect the content of text messages or calls  A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that Facebook uses the information to rank contacts in Messenger so they are easier to find  and to suggest people to call 
Users get the option to allow data collection when they sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite  the Facebook posting said   If you chose to turn this feature on  we will begin to continuously log this information   the posting said 
The data collection can be turned off in a user s settings  and all previously collected call and text history shared on the app will be deleted  Facebook said 
The feature was first introduced on Facebook Messenger in 2015 and added later on Facebook Lite 
Messages were left Sunday seeking comment about security from Google officials  who make the Android operating system 
Reports of the data collection came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took out ads in multiple U S  and British Sunday newspapers to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal 
The ads say the social media platform doesn t deserve to hold personal information if it can t protect it 
According to the ads  a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago  Zuckerberg said this was a  breach of trust  and that Facebook is taking steps to make sure it doesn t happen again 
Facebook s privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica  a Trump affiliated political consulting firm  got data inappropriately  The social media platform s stock value has dropped over  70 billion since the revelations were first published 
Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U S   and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom 
The ads said Facebook is limiting the data apps received when users sign in  It s also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data   We expect there are others  And when we find them  we will ban them and tell everyone affected   the ads stated 
Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270 000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014  But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well  bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million 
The Trump campaign paid the firm  6 million during the 2016 election  although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge 
SYDNEY    Australian authorities say they are investigating whether Facebook breached the country s privacy law when personal information of more than 300 000 Australian users was obtained by Cambridge Analytica  a Trump linked political consulting firm  without their authorization 
Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk said Thursday that the Privacy Act requires all organizations to ensure personal information is held securely  Customers must also be adequately notified about the collection and handling of personal information 
Each breach of the Privacy Act can involve a 420 000 Australian dollar fine   323 000   The privacy commissioner can also seek a court injunction and require offenders to pledge  under threat of further court action  to prevent further breaches

Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months 
The changes won t affect Facebook s privacy policies or the types of data it gathers about its users  But the company hopes its 2 2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings 
Facebook says it s trying to make the controls easier to find and to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them 
Wednesday s announcement follows revelations that a Trump affiliated consulting firm got data on millions of unsuspecting Facebook users  Facebook is also facing criticism for collecting years of data on call and text histories from Android users

NEW YORK    Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months

Wednesday s announcement follows revelations that a Trump affiliated consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica  got data on millions of Facebook users  That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app  even though those friends hadn t given explicit consent to sharing  In addition  Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names  telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users  The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it  On Monday  the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices 
Facebook s chief privacy officer  Erin Egan  said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for  some time  but the events of the past several days underscore their importance  
Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks  but gave no further details 
The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings  yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people  For example  Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page 
Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls  Now  Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place  Facebook says it is also adding  clearer explanations  about how its privacy controls work 
Chris Cox  Facebook s chief product officer  called the new settings  the first of many steps  the company is taking to address privacy concerns 
Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25  The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data  They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents  no matter where it is based 
To comply with this  Facebook is adding a section called  access your information   a secure way for users to manage data they ve shared with the company  including status updates  comments and things they have searched for  That s where people can go to delete information or download a copy  While this download was already possible  it took some time to figure out how to do it  Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail  without having to download it  For example  users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past 
Cox said that while the changes are  in line with the principle of GDPR   there s also a  bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that  
Facebook also said it will propose updates to its terms of service in the coming weeks and update its privacy policy  but gave no further details 
 Reuters    Facebook Inc  responding to reports in some technology industry media that it has been logging users  call and text history without their permission  said in a statement on Sunday that the function  has always been opt in only  
The social media site said that when the feature is enabled by the user and contact information is uploaded  the platform can then use the given data when a call or text was made or received with Facebook Lite and Facebook Messenger services 
Facebook specified that it does not collect the content of calls or text messages and information is securely stored  This data is not sold to third parties  Facebook s statement said 
 You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people s call and SMS  text  history without their permission  This is not the case   Facebook s statement said 
The Verge website reported that some Twitter users said they found months or years of call history data in their downloadable Facebook data file  Ars Technica reported Facebook requested access to contacts  SMS data and call history on Android devices to improve its friend recommendation algorithm 
 Call and text history logging is part of an opt in feature for people using Messenger  While we receive certain permissions from Android  uploading this information has always been opt in only   the world s largest social media network said 
 People have to expressly agree to use this feature   the statement said

Here are some of the poll s key findings 
NO PROFILE MAKEOVER
The poll found that many Americans have not taken steps to protect their information 
   86 percent said they have not changed their login credentials on Facebook  Twitter or other social media platforms 
   78 percent have not switched to  private mode  on their browser 
   96 percent have not turned to more secure  encrypted apps like Signal and WhatsApp

FACEBOOK STILL GETS LIKES
Facebook remains the most popular social media network in the United States by far  More than half of adults said they access the site continuously throughout the day  Other platforms like Instagram and Snapchat do not come close 
PRIVACY CONCERNS LOW
The Reuters Ipsos poll asked Americans who do not use Facebook regularly why not 
Within that group  30 percent said they do not find it that interesting or useful  16 percent said they are concerned about their privacy and do not want to share personal information with strangers  Only 4 percent said they are afraid their account will get hacked

In January  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had announced the changes that first rolled out in the United States and would expand to a global audience 
The changes come amid allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to Facebook users  information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U S  President Donald Trump in 2016

WASHINGTON    The leading U S  consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 states stepped up pressure on Facebook Inc on Monday to explain how the social network allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy 
The U S  Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing that it had opened an investigation into the company   which it generally only does in cases of great public interest   citing media reports that raise what it called  substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  
On the same day  a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to Facebook  demanding to know more about the company s role in the manipulation of users  data by the consultancy  Cambridge Analytica  which used it to target U S  and British voters in close run elections 
 These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook s policies and practices  and the processes in place to ensure they are followed   the letter said   We need to know that users can trust Facebook  With the information we have now  our trust has been broken  
Facebook shares fell as much as 6 5 percent  briefly dipping below  150 for the first time since July 2017  before recovering the day s losses to close up 0 4 percent at  160 06 
The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16  when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica  The company has lost more than  70 billion in market value since then 
The recovery in Facebook s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company s relative long term growth prospects  Wall Street analysts said 
The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices  a person briefed on the matter told Reuters 
If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree  it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation  which could add up to billions of dollars 
 We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said in a statement on Monday   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have  
ALL APOLOGIES
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company s privacy practices 
The U S  Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy 
The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing 
 Facebook s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments  but also basic norms and standards   said U S  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  a member of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee 
In Europe  the European Union Justice Commissioner asked  Facebook if the company is  absolutely certain  that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated 
Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers  access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy  He also said sorry in full page advertisements in British and U S  newspapers 
 The was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time   Zuckerberg said in the ads   We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again  
 FUTURE REGULATION 
His apologies have failed to quell discontent  Germany s justice minister said Facebook s promises were not enough 
 In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly   Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan 
Advertisers and users are also unhappy 
U S  auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook  Instagram  Twitter and Alphabet s YouTube for one week

The Reuters Ipsos online poll found that 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information  compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon com Inc  62 percent who trust Alphabet Inc s Google  60 percent for Microsoft Corp 
The poll was conducted from Wednesday through Friday and had 2 237 responses   https   reut rs 2G9hvrv 
The German poll published by Bild was conducted by Kantar EMNID  a unit of global advertising holding company WPP  using representative polling methods  the firm said  Overall  only 33 percent found social media had a positive effect on democracy  against 60 percent who believed the opposite 
It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook  eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said in an interview  Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith  she said 
 It s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that s become pretty well ingrained into people s lives   she said 
Data supplied to Reuters by the Israeli firm SimilarWeb  which measures global online audiences  indicated that Facebook usage in major markets and worldwide remained steady over the past week 
 Desktop  mobile and app usage has remained steady and well within the expected range   said Gitit Greenberg  SimilarWeb s director of market insights   It is important to separate frustration from actual tangible impacts to Facebook usage

BERLIN    Misuse of data by Facebook means it will in future be bound by stricter regulations and the threat of tougher penalties for further privacy violations  Germany s justice minister said on Monday 
Katarina Barley spoke after talks to which she summoned executives of the firm including European public affairs chief Richard Allan 
 Facebook admitted abuses and excesses in the past and gave assurances that measures since taken mean they can t happen again   she said   But promises aren t enough  In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly  
The firm has faced a global outcry over allegations that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters in close run elections 
Facebook s shares fell more than 5 percent on Wall Street on Monday after the U S  consumer protection regulator made public the fact it is investigating the firm over the Cambridge Analytica link 
Facebook managers were not present for Barley s news conference  held after a meeting she called  long  intensive and controversial  
She said the firm told her around 1 percent of 300 000 users of a personality quiz whose results were later fed into Cambridge Analytica s voter targeting algorithms were in Europe 
It was still unclear how many of them were in Germany  or how many of the further 50 million users in their friendship circles whose data the consultancy used were in Germany or Europe  she said 
Facebook had promised to try and contact all those affected 
Memories of two 20th century totalitarian surveillance states make privacy issues especially sensitive in Germany  where competition authorities have since last year been probing the social network s use of data from partner websites 
 We need well equipped data protection authorities and confident users who know their rights   Barley said   The sovereignty of users must be strengthened  
Federal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt told Tagesspiegel in comments released by the newspaper on Monday that users were largely unaware how much information flowed to the social network when they visited third party websites with Facebook integration 
The office was working on the basis of possible abuses stemming from  the collection and assessment of data from third party sources outside Facebook   he said 
Facebook declined to comment on Mundt s remarks

It s hard to imagine now  but at one point  long ago  Facebook did not monopolize the entire tech news cycle   a heady and innocent era when you could read an entire day s news without encountering the words  Cambridge Analytica  or  third party developers  
I confess that  like many of you  I have been obsessed with the fallout from Facebook s latest privacy scandal  to the point that I had a stress dream that I overslept and missed covering Mark Zuckerberg s testimony on Capitol Hill next week   Related  I need to get out more  and possibly take up yoga  
But despite the wall to wall news of the past few weeks  lots of important things are happening in the tech world that don t involve Facebook  So let s run down a few of them 
I thought this article by Scott Shane and Daisuke Wakabayashi  about thousands of Google employees who are protesting the company s involvement in a Pentagon A I  program  was fascinating on a number of levels 
First  it s an unusually clear example of the double edged nature of artificial intelligence  Google has spent billions of dollars teaching computers to play Go  drive cars and translate languages on the fly  The company has been extremely proud of its advances in machine learning  even releasing some of its tools to the public via open source frameworks like TensorFlow  which provides a fascinating contrast to what s happening inside the company now  When its image classification algorithms are used to spot tumors on radiology scans  Google puts out a press release  and engineers cheer  But when these same types of algorithms are used by the Pentagon to improve the accuracy of drone strikes  it s a moral outrage 
Yonatan Zunger  a former Google engineer  had an interesting op ed the other day in The Boston Globe about the  reckonings  that various scientific fields have undergone  as the scientists who develop powerful tools begin to see how those tools can be used for evil purposes  He used the examples of the atomic bomb  which forever changed the way that physics was taught in universities  and dynamite  which made chemists aware of the consequences of their expertise  It s not hard to see A I  as a similar kind of turning point for computer scientists   and if it is  the Google Pentagon issue might be the first of many similar fights 
Second  the Google Pentagon incident is a revealing story about the leverage that Silicon Valley engineers have over their companies  Because the labor market for engineers in the Bay Area is so tight  and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent  these employees have much more say in how a company like Google governs itself than  say  regulators or outside activists  If an antiwar group protests outside Google s headquarters  it s an annoyance  But if 3 000 engineers walk out  it s a crisis  And as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning  executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn t regulation  it s rebellion from within 
I ve also been following the feud between Amazon and President Trump this week  which has led to a bull market for explainers about the business models of the United States Postal Service  My colleague Nick Wingfield wrote that  contra President Trump  the available evidence suggests that  Amazon has been a boon to the Postal Service   But Vox s Jen Kirby added that  because the exact details of the contract between Amazon and the Postal Service aren t known  it s possible that President Trump is partly right   Maybe the U S P S  isn t actually making the best deals   Meanwhile  Matt Stoller  a fellow at the Open Markets Institute  says President Trump is  actually right  that Amazon is ripping off the federal government through its U S P S  contracts 
I m a nonexpert on the subject of parcel shipping  so my opinion on Amazon s the  U S P S  probably isn t worth one first class stamp  But it s possible  and maybe plausible  that all of these analyses are partly correct   that the Postal Service benefits from Amazon s dominance  and that Amazon is getting a sweetheart deal that should be re examined  Anyway  Amazon s stock dipped sharply after President Trump started tweeting angry things about it  but it has now recovered to its pre tweetstorm levels  meaning that investors may be as confused as I am 
Last  and most obvious  the horrific shooting at YouTube on Tuesday  which injured three people and left the company badly shaken  As more details have emerged on Nasim Najafi Aghdam  whom the police have identified as the attacker  it has become increasingly clear that this was a new kind of violence   an act of revenge by an internet creator against the platform that she felt controlled her economic destiny  As my colleagues Nellie Bowles and Jack Nicas wrote   Ms  Aghdam s complaints echoed what a wide range of YouTube posters   from self described animal rights activists like her to right wing political provocateurs   have increasingly been protesting over the last year  
It s a tragic reminder that social platforms aren t just websites anymore  They re powerful economies unto themselves  and even seemingly minor policy decisions can alter the lives of millions of people  a few of whom might be disturbed enough to act on their darkest impulses

WASHINGTON    The leading U S  consumer protection regulator and attorneys representing 37 states stepped up pressure on Facebook Inc on Monday to explain how the social network allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy 
The U S  Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing that it had opened an investigation into the company   which it generally only does in cases of great public interest   citing media reports that raise what it called  substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook  
On the same day  a bipartisan coalition of 37 state attorneys wrote to Facebook  demanding to know more about the company s role in the manipulation of users  data by the consultancy  Cambridge Analytica  which used it to target U S  and British voters in close run elections 
 These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook s policies and practices  and the processes in place to ensure they are followed   the letter said   We need to know that users can trust Facebook  With the information we have now  our trust has been broken  
Facebook shares fell as much as 6 5 percent  briefly dipping below  150 for the first time since July 2017  before recovering the day s losses to close up 0 4 percent at  160 06 
The shares are still down 13 percent since March 16  when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica  The company has lost more than  70 billion in market value since then 
The recovery in Facebook s stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company s relative long term growth prospects  Wall Street analysts said 
The FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices  a person briefed on the matter told Reuters 
If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree  it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation  which could add up to billions of dollars 
 We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said in a statement on Monday   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have  
ALL APOLOGIES
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company s privacy practices 
The U S  Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy 
The U S  House Energy and Commerce Committee and U S  Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing 
 Facebook s failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments  but also basic norms and standards   said U S  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  a member of the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee 
In Europe  the European Union Justice Commissioner asked  Facebook if the company is  absolutely certain  that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated 
Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers  access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy  He also said sorry in full page advertisements in British and U S  newspapers 
 The was a breach of trust  and I m sorry we didn t do more at the time   Zuckerberg said in the ads   We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn t happen again  
 FUTURE REGULATION 
His apologies have failed to quell discontent  Germany s justice minister said Facebook s promises were not enough 
 In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly   Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan 
Advertisers and users are also unhappy 
U S  auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook  Instagram  Twitter and Alphabet s YouTube for one week 
Internet company Mozilla Corp  Germany s second largest bank Commerzbank AG and British advertising group ISBA all suspended advertising on Facebook last week 
Opinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook 
Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U S  privacy laws  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Sunday  while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag  Germany s largest selling Sunday paper  found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy

 Reuters    U S  auto parts retailer Pep Boys said on Monday it is suspending all advertising on Facebook Inc following concerns of data privacy  joining internet company Mozilla Corp in pulling ads from the social networking site 
The decision follows allegations that a political consultancy gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users to build profiles on American voters that were later used to help elect U S  President Donald Trump in 2016 
 We are concerned about the issues surrounding Facebook and have decided to suspend all media on the platform until the facts are out and corrective actions have been taken   Pep Boys chief marketing officer Danielle Porto Mohn said in a statement 
 This version of the story was corrected to change the company description to auto parts retailer from tire maker

 Reuters    Shares of Acxiom Corp plunged as much as 34 percent on Thursday  after Facebook Inc said it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network 
The stock has now lost nearly half of its market value since Facebook s comments on Wednesday that added to fears of increased scrutiny around how public data is handled and shared 
Facebook is under pressure to improve how it manages data after disclosing that information on about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica 
The social network has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom  Facebook s website lists nine third party data providers that it has worked with  including Acxiom  Experian PLC  Oracle Data Cloud  TransUnion and WPP PLC 
Arkansas based Acxiom  which earns over  800 million a year selling consumer profiles to the world s largest companies  said late on Wednesday it did not expect this change to impact its revenue or earnings for the year ending in March 
However  for fiscal year 2019  Acxiom expects total revenue and profitability to be hurt by as much as  25 million 
 The immediate impact was small  Now the question is how far does Facebook react to its issues   First Analysis analyst Larry Berlin said 
 A lot of what  Acxiom  is doing is probably not wrong and probably not at the core of the problem that Facebook has  Targeting consumers using data is sometimes very clean and sometimes it isn t  
Even with little raw data  third party data providers like  Acxiom attempt to build detailed pictures of individuals  finances  relationships  personal interests and purchasing tastes 
These profiles power targeted advertising across the internet  and can also be used to determine what political issues people are interested in and how they might vote 
 I welcome Facebook s announcement that it will be shutting down its partner category service  using third party data to inform targeted advertising   said Britain s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham in a statement on Thursday 
WPP  Experian  TransUnion and Cisco did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Shares of Acxiom were down 32 percent at  19 by midday  The stock touch its lowest in more than 2 years in early trading 
TransUnion fell nearly 1 percent  while WPP was down marginally

 Reuters    Facebook Inc is giving users more control over their privacy by making data management easier and redesigning the settings menu  the company said on Wednesday  in the wake of a scandal over a breach that exposed the personal information of millions and was allegedly used by a political consultancy 
The company also said it would propose in the coming weeks updates to the social media website s terms of service and data policy to better spell out what information it collects and how it uses it 
The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters in close run elections 
Facebook shares are down nearly 18 percent since March 16  when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica  eating away nearly  100 billion of the company s market value 
 We ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find  and that we must do more to keep people informed   Erin Egan  Facebook s chief privacy officer  and Ashlie Beringer  its deputy general counsel  said in a statement 
In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices  Facebook said it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information  It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared  including posts and search queries 
Users would be able to download the data shared with Facebook  including uploaded photos  contacts added to their account  and posts on timelines

The House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate Commerce committees have also asked him to testify but have not set dates

CHICAGO    It s a scandal of privacy  politics and an essential ingredient of business success   public trust 
Facebook is confronting a costly  embarrassing public relations debacle after revelations that Cambridge Analytica may have misused data from some 50 million users to try to influence elections  Among its marquee clients  President Donald Trump s general election campaign 
Now a company known as much for reminders of a long lost friend s birthday and documentation of acquaintances  every whim is grappling with outrage   and the possible loss of confidence   from users around the globe that have made the social media site a part of their daily routine 
 I trust somebody until they give me a reason not to trust them   said Joseph Holt  who teaches business ethics at the University of Notre Dame   And Facebook has increasingly given me reasons not to trust them  
Losing that would be a disaster  not just for Facebook  but for any Silicon Valley company that relies on users to open up their private lives 
The amount of trust placed in technology has soared  Cars sync with cell phones  Refrigerators know when there s no more milk and reorder it  Virtual assistants field answers to nearly any inane question 
And with each turn of the steering wheel  sip of milk or request for dinner reservations  a trail of digital crumbs is left for companies to collect  analyze and profit off 
The public has largely been willing to accept the trade off  knowing in exchange for giving up some data  Netflix will offer spot on show suggestions  Amazon will prompt a diaper order and Google will figure out what to search before a user finishes typing it 
Not everyone understands the darker side of data brokers in an always connected society 
Every time a person shops online or at a store  loyalty cards linked to phone numbers or email addresses can be linked to other databases that may have location data  home addresses and more  Voting records  job history  credit scores  remember the Equifax hack   are constantly mixed  matched and traded by companies in ways regulators haven t caught up with 
While Facebook let slip data profiles on millions of people   it s much more than that   says James Grimmelmann  a professor at Cornell Law School   Trying to pin down any one breach as being the source of all the privacy harms out there is futile  
For Facebook  whose power and value are built on being so ever present in people s lives  the impact has been immediate   its share price is down nearly 14 percent since the scandal broke March 16 
Investors fear that Facebook users will start to think twice before posting the latest snapshots of their puppy  or clicking  like  on a news story or movie trailer 
 It s something that s going to remain in people s memory   says Mike Chapple  a University of Notre Dame professor with expertise in cybersecurity   I think it s changed people s perceptions  
After the scandal broke  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized  admitted his company s mistakes and said security needs to be enhanced to protect users  data  He noted that this is a major trust issue for the public 
It follows closely on the heels of the company acknowledging it helped spread fake news and propaganda from Russian linked trolls disrupting the 2016 presidential election 
While some disenchanted Facebook users have deactivated their accounts  others point out that breaking up can be hard to do  If a credit card company or an airline s data is breached  it s easy enough to switch allegiances  But for most of Facebook s 2 billion users there s no real substitute  says Aaron Gordon  a partner at Schwartz Media Strategies  a Miami based public relations and crisis management firm 
 It s a lot harder to just up and leave   he says   So you go to Twitter or Instagram  It s not the same  
 Besides  Instagram is owned by Facebook  
Holt  the business ethics professor  loved Facebook  but with all that s come out  he feels like he s in an abusive relationship  He estimates he cut his usage from about 30 minutes daily to about 10 minutes every other day and would happily flee altogether if a viable alternative emerged that more zealously protected data 
 I haven t left it yet  but I go less often and I feel less good about it   he says 
Facebook is not the only company to deal with misuse of private information that has weakened public confidence  Equifax  the credit reporting agency  and Target  the retail giant  both suffered massive data breaches affecting tens of millions of people  Wells Fargo faced stiff government fines for a fake accounts scandal 
The public tends to get numb to this steady drumbeat of bad news  says brand strategist Rachel Brand 
 People pick their battles and daily outrage   she says   Facebook messed up royally  but most people are on a daily outrage roller coaster and aren t sure if this is the hill worth dying on

As a start up called Cambridge Analytica sought to harvest the Facebook data of tens of millions of Americans in summer 2014  the company received help from at least one employee at Palantir Technologies  a top Silicon Valley contractor to American spy agencies and the Pentagon 
It was a Palantir employee in London  working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge s psychological profiling technology  who suggested the scientists create their own app   a mobile phone based personality quiz   to gain access to Facebook users  friend networks  according to documents obtained by The New York Times 
Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach  By early summer  the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app  The researcher scraped private data from over 50 million Facebook users   and Cambridge Analytica went into business selling so called psychometric profiles of American voters  setting itself on a collision course with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain 
 Read more about the Cambridge Analytica whistle blower contending that data mining swung the Brexit referendum  
The revelations pulled Palantir   co founded by the wealthy libertarian Peter Thiel   into the furor surrounding Cambridge  which improperly obtained Facebook data to build analytical tools it deployed on behalf of Donald J  Trump and other Republican candidates in 2016  Mr  Thiel  a supporter of President Trump  serves on the board at Facebook 
 There were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data   said Christopher Wylie  a data expert and Cambridge Analytica co founder  in testimony before British lawmakers on Tuesday 
Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times  The Observer of London and The Guardian 
The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr  Wylie s testimony on Tuesday  Both companies are linked to tech driven billionaires who backed Mr  Trump s campaign  Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer  the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate  while Palantir was co founded in 2003 by Mr  Thiel  who was an initial investor in Facebook 
The Palantir employee  Alfredas Chmieliauskas  works on business development for the company  according to his LinkedIn page  In an initial statement  Palantir said it had  never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica  nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data   Later on Tuesday  Palantir revised its account  saying that Mr  Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company s behalf when he advised Mr  Wylie on the Facebook data 
 We learned today that an employee  in 2013 2014  engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica   the company said   We are looking into this and will take the appropriate action  
The company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort  Mr  Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role 
Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013  Mr  Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr  Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account  At the time  Mr  Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group  which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr  Mercer the next year  The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles  a product code named  Big Daddy  
A former intern at SCL   Sophie Schmidt  the daughter of Eric Schmidt  then Google s executive chairman   urged the company to link up with Palantir  according to Mr  Wylie s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times 
 Ever come across Palantir  Amusingly Eric Schmidt s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them   one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email 
Ms  Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment  nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica 
In early 2013  Alexander Nix  an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns 
A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership  in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work  Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr  Nix and Mr  Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014  but Palantir executives again declined 
In his testimony  Mr  Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship  But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge s psychographic models 
 There were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data   Mr  Wylie told lawmakers   And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir   He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them 
Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge s backing from Mr  Mercer  one of the world s richest men  according to messages viewed by The Times  And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business 
In an interview this month with The Times  Mr  Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics  Those discussions continued through spring 2014  according to Mr  Wylie 
Mr  Wylie said that he and Mr  Nix visited Palantir s London office on Soho Square  One side was set up like a high security office  Mr  Wylie said  with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes  The other side  he said  was like a tech start up    weird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer  and there s a Ping Pong table  
Mr  Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr  Wylie s team in 2014  as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University  Michal Kosinski  to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr  Kosinski had built  The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients 
 I had left field idea   Mr  Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014   What about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook   Reproducing the app  Mr  Chmieliauskas wrote   could be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy  
Those negotiations failed  But Mr  Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher  the Russian American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan  who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook  Over subsequent months  Dr  Kogan s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters 
The news that Facebook s Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant  But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting   and when   in the first place 
The short answer  Because Google let it  The longer answer  Well  it s complicated 
The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google s Android system in 2015   first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite  a stripped down version of its main app  Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected  that it didn t collect the contents of messages or calls  and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings 
Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics  The kerfuffle over this data collection  first reported by the website Ars Technica   follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections 
There s a reason Facebook s actions were restricted to Android phones  Apple locks down app permissions tightly  which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users   Apple s fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running  and keep customers in control of the information   said Rich Mogull  CEO of the security firm Securosis 
But Android has long been more indulgent 
Until recently  in fact  Google let app developers gain access to a phone s call and text logs  All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts  Once users agreed  Android would then also grant access to those communication histories 
Starting in 2012 with its  Jelly Bean  release  Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs  but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once  Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn t work 
It wasn t until 2015 when Google released Android 6 0  dubbed  Marshmallow   that Android phones finally split up those permissions  That meant users could agree to share contacts  but reject access to their messaging and phone histories 
That s the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information  But many Android users aren t using the latest version of the software  In fact  they often can t get it even if they want it 
Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones  which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will  Google  by contrast  is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions 
There are nearly 20 000 Android phone models now in service  and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks  As a result  new Android versions reach users very slowly 
As of January  about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software  introduced in 2017  Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android  known as  Oreo    Many of them are owners of Google s new Pixel phones  which get software updates directly from Google  
Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions  which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs  Last October  Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates  even on phones running older versions of Android 
All that leaves two big questions unanswered  Why did Google set up Android permissions this way  And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup 
Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google s advertising based business model  which   like Facebook   depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads  Apple  meanwhile  derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music 
Another possible factor  Android was playing catch up with Apple for many years  and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple s App Store  Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive   as Facebook did 
Experts say it s not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts  but it s very possible 
 In a lot of ways  Facebook is the tip of the iceberg   said Bob O Donnell  chief analyst at Technalysis Research   There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection  
It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users  call logs had been sent to app developers  A Google spokesperson declined to comment 
One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy   At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution   LG Electronics Inc  said Tuesday in a statement

GENEVA    The scandal over data privacy that is causing a headache for Facebook Inc shows just one aspect of the huge task of preparing the world for e commerce  the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday 
Facebook has faced a global outcry and its shares have slid in value after a whistleblower said data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U S  and British voters 
 The current debate about Facebook and data privacy vividly illustrates that most countries are ill prepared for the digital economy   UNCTAD Secretary General Mukhisa Kituyi said in a statement 
Data privacy is just one of many boxes that national regulators need to tick if they hope to get a handle on e commerce  UNCTAD s head of internet and computer technology analysis Torbjörn Fredriksson told a news conference 
Other issues include legal questions related to e transactions and e signatures  consumer protection online  data protection  cybercrime  taxation and domain names 
 Then you look at trade logistics  especially to try to address what we call the tsunami of parcels  when people start ordering from online platforms instead of going to the retail shop that has bought everything in bulk   he said 
In developing countries  internet purchases are still mainly paid for with cash on delivery  and central banks and finance ministries need to help ensure access to online payment systems  Fredriksson added 
But most developing countries are still unclear about whose job it is to coordinate e commerce  he said 
Without online payments  local firms would struggle to export on international e commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba  while the flood of imports risks creating a trade imbalance 
 There is some concern that     there is a risk of concentration of markets among the big platforms   Fredriksson said  adding that UNCTAD was working on ways to address the problem 
Although rich countries are thinking about how they need to adapt  poorer countries are largely flying blind  with no data for example on e commerce circumventing national trade rules  which could help the traffic in counterfeit goods 
 There are concerns about jobs that may be lost  taxation  customs revenue  there s a whole range of issues that are challenges more than opportunities perhaps   Fredriksson said 
 Governments are increasingly looking at it  but whether they are looking at it enough is another issue

Many months after it became clear that Russians exploited Facebook to interfere in the 2016 presidential election  the reach and impact of Russia s activities on the social network are still not fully known 
The indictment announced on Friday in the investigation by the special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  charged 13 Russians and does not accuse Facebook or Instagram of any wrongdoing  But the names of those two networks appear 41 times in the indictment 
The dribble of information about Russian actors  use of Facebook  as well as confusing messages coming from the company  has raised even more questions  Here s a look at what we know and what other information Facebook might be able to provide 
So far  Facebook executives have implied that the influence campaign was minor in the scheme of things 
The company has released numbers that suggest the Russians reached a large number of people  In testimony to Congress last year  Colin Stretch  Facebook s general counsel  said that roughly 126 million people may have been  served content  from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency  the notorious Russian troll factory  over a two year period 
But Mr  Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook 
And on Friday  Rob Goldman  Facebook s vice president for ads  noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads  56 percent  were served after the 2016 election 
Quoting tiny fractions suggests content on Facebook gets drowned out in a torrent of information  But the company s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well targeted users 
Questions for Facebook 
Mr  Mueller s latest indictment says that  after the middle of 2016  Russians often talked about targeting  purple states   or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close  The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida  which Mr  Trump ended up winning 
Others have asserted in the past that Russia did not appear to focus its social media efforts on swing states  As Senator Richard Burr  Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  noted last year 
Questions for Facebook  
Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia  has done revealing work on Facebook s Russia linked pages that is more detailed than anything the company has made public  Mr  Albright s data  obtained using CrowdTangle  an analytics tool owned by Facebook  shows the speed with which the Russia backed groups grew 
Blacktivist  a Russia linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African American rights  had 14 000 followers at the end of 2015  By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year  it had 390 000  according to Mr  Albright s data   a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter  Other Russian created groups  like Heart of Texas  also showed huge increases in followers 
Questions for Facebook 
It may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr  Trump  But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows  And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation s understanding of what went on 
 I can t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data   Mr  Albright said 
LONDON    The computer expert who alleges a trove of Facebook data was improperly used to help Donald Trump s White House bid said Tuesday that he strongly believes the information was also used by the Brexit movement that persuaded Britain to quit the European Union 
In a 3½ hour hearing  Chris Wylie told the House of Commons media committee that he believes the breach exceeded the 50 million Facebook users reported earlier   though he didn t give an exact figure  And he said the data compiled by the political consulting business Cambridge Analytica was available to other firms with links to it 
 All kinds of people had access to the data   said Wylie  who helped develop Cambridge Analytica s methods for using the information to target and persuade voters   It was everywhere  
Among the companies that had access to the data was AggregateIQ  a Canadian political consultant that did work for Vote Leave  the official campaign backing Britain s withdrawal from the EU  Wylie said 
Wylie described Cambridge Analytica as just one arm of a global company  SCL Group  that gets most of its income from military contracts but is also a political gun for hire  often in countries where democratic institutions are weak  He suggested the company combines computer algorithms and dirty tricks to help candidates win regardless of the cost 
The 28 year old Canadian with a swath of pink hair says he helped set up Cambridge Analytica in 2013  He left the next year 
Wylie has previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used personal data improperly collected from Facebook users to help Trump s 2016 presidential campaign 
Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in its work on the Trump campaign  It denies any wrongdoing 
Cambridge Analytica s acting CEO  Alexander Tayler  said in a statement that Wylie was a part time contractor who  has no direct knowledge of our work or practices  since he left the company 
Wylie said he  absolutely  believes AggregateIQ drew on Cambridge Analytica s databases for its work on the Brexit campaign  In the closely fought referendum in 2016  51 9 percent of voters backed Britain s departure from the EU 
 I think it is incredibly reasonable to say that AIQ played a very significant role in Leave winning   Wylie said 
He testified that AggregateIQ was formed when Cambridge Analytica sought to expand but Canadians he wanted to bring into the business didn t want to relocate to Britain  The two firms shared underlying technology and worked so closely together that Cambridge Analytica staff often referred to the Canadian firm as a  department   he said 
Because of the links between the two companies  Vote Leave got the  the next best thing  to Cambridge Analytica when it hired AggregateIQ   a company that can do virtually everything that  Cambridge Analytica  can do but with a different billing name   Wylie said 
AggregateIQ  based in Victoria  British Columbia  issued a statement saying it has never been part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL 
 AggregateIQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where it operates   the company said   All work AggregateIQ does for each client is kept separate from every other client  
Wylie s testimony came a day after Wylie and two other former insiders presented 50 pages of documents that they said proved Vote Leave violated election finance rules during the referendum campaign 
They allege that Vote Leave circumvented spending limits by donating 625 000 pounds   888 000  to the pro Brexit student group BeLeave  which then sent the money directly to AggregateIQ 
Vote Leave denies breaking any campaign finance regulations  Dominic Cummings  the Vote Leave strategist  called Wylie a  fantasist charlatan  
LONDON    Investigators from Britain s data watchdog searched the London offices of Cambridge Analytica  the data analytics firm at the center of a storm over allegations it improperly harvested Facebook data to target U S  voters 
About 20 officials  wearing black jackets with  ICO Enforcement  on them  arrived at the firm s central London offices on Friday evening soon after a High Court judge granted a search warrant sought by the Information Commissioner s Office  ICO  
The officials concluded the search around 0300 GMT on Saturday   We will now need to assess and consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions   an ICO spokesperson said in a statement 
The officials  who were let into the building by security guards  were seen checking books and papers through the windows of the second floor offices on London s busy New Oxford Street  a Reuters witness said 
Elizabeth Denham  head of the ICO  sought the warrant after a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica had gathered private information of 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump s 2016 U S  presidential campaign 
Britain is investigating whether Facebook  the world s largest social media network  did enough to protect data 
U S  lawmakers on Friday asked Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to come to Congress to explain to explain how the data got into Cambridge Analytica s hands  adding to pressure on the firm  which is under fire from investors and advertisers 
Separately on Friday  Britain s Guardian newspaper said a former Cambridge Analytica political consultant had accused the company s management of misleading the British public about work it did for a pro Brexit group before the vote to leave the European Union 
Brittany Kaiser  a business development director at the company from 2014 until earlier this year  told the Guardian that Cambridge Analytica carried out data crunching and analysis work for Leave EU  while publicly denying it was doing so 
Arron Banks  a major donor to Leave EU  told the newspaper that Leave EU did not receive any data or work from Cambridge Analytica although the UK Independence Party  which also campaigned for Brexit  gave the firm some of its data which the firm analyzed 
 But it was not used in the Brexit campaign  Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused  It had nothing to do with us   Banks was quoted as saying 
Efforts by the ICO to investigate Cambridge Analytica had hit a snag on Thursday after a judge adjourned its application to search the British consultancy group s office by 24 hours 
U S  and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the British consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users  raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy 
Facebook s Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company made mistakes in mishandling data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers access to data

LONDON    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company s subscribers  The fact is  European regulators are already forcing him to do so 
A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than  1 6 billion under the European Union s new General Data Protection Regulation  which will be enforced from May 25  The rules  approved two years ago  also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents  no matter where it is based 
The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax  stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights  European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995  when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place  The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well 
 For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights  we are grateful to Europe   said Siva Vaidhyanathan  a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property   I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy  I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen s rights in 1998  the start of Google   but I ll settle for 2018  
The U S  has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies  with concerns about stifling the technology fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama s 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights  But Europe has been more aggressive 
EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google s dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon  The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized  the right to be forgotten   allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there s no compelling reason for it to remain 
Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28 nation bloc  where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee  Nazi Germany s use of personal information to target Jews hasn t been forgotten  and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments 
In today s world  digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like  This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers 
But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes 
A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election  News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix  former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer  who bankrolled the operation 
Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign  Facebook is investigating 
 The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services   said David Reed  knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ  a London based firm that provides research on data issues 
The EU s new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc  regardless of where the company is based  Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point  and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation  the EU says 
While Facebook is based in Menlo Park  California  it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1 4 billion globally 
The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand  No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking  I Agree   The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give 
To ensure compliance  there s the potential for big fines  Under GDPR  organizations face fines of up to 20 million euros   25 million  or 4 percent of annual global turnover   whichever is greater   for the most serious violations 
Facebook reported  40 65 billion in revenue last year  That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as  1 63 billion 
Even though GDPR doesn t legally protect the data of people outside the EU  analysts expect many companies to apply the rules worldwide  Smaller firms are likely to decide it s too expensive to run multiple compliance systems  though bigger firms like Facebook and Google may still decide to  bracket off  European operations  Vaidhyanathan said 
Sarah T  Roberts  a professor of information studies at UCLA  says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement  rather than allowing internet companies to dictate  While U S  based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley  that type of bravado and no holds barred capitalism doesn t go down well in Europe 
 Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth  that is not true   she said 
Facebook  for one  has taken notice  setting aside a page of its website to explain what the company is doing to comply with GDPR   We ve built tools to help people manage their data and understand their choices with respect to how we use their personal data   it says 
But GDPR is not a panacea that will ensure everyone s data is protected  Some analysts suggest the next step should be to ensure that everyone owns their own data and can sell it in exchange for services 
Pressure is building for increased regulation in the U S   where members of Congress have called on Zuckerberg to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal 
The alleged conspiracy has captured the public imagination  focusing worldwide attention on data protection  Vaidhyanathan said 
 Cambridge Analytica s story sounds like a spy novel   he said   It has a bond villain in Alexander Nix  It has a secretive billionaire genius in Robert Mercer  It has the evil sidekick in Steve Bannon  It is working for right wing interests and it claims to be able to control our minds   he said   We needed a few Bond villains to make the story lively  
BEIJING    Executives from Apple Inc and IBM Corp have called for more oversight on how personal data is used following the Facebook Inc breach that saw roughly 50 million users  data misused by consultancy Cambridge Analytica 
Speaking at the three day China Development Forum in Beijing  Apple chief Tim Cook said  well crafted  regulation was required  while IBM Corp chief Virginia Rometty said users should have more agency over their own data 
 It s clear to me that something  some large profound change is needed   said Apple chief Tim Cook on Saturday 
 I m personally not a big fan of regulation because sometimes regulation can have unexpected consequences to it  however I think this certain situation is so dire  and has become so large  that probably some well crafted regulation is necessary   said Cook  who co chaired the event this year 
Facebook has come under intense scrutiny from users  lawmakers and investors following allegations from a whistleblower that it allowed British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to improperly use data and build voter profiles that were later used to help elect U S  President Donald Trump in 2016 
U S  lawmakers on Friday officially requested that Facebook s Mark Zuckaberg explain at a congressional hearing how user s data was released to the consultancy 
The breach has sparked intense debate over the responsibility of large tech firms to properly inform users of how their data is used 
 If you re going to use these technologies  you have to tell people you re doing that  and they should never be surprised   IBM chief executive Rometty said on Monday 
  We have to let  people opt in and opt out  and be clear that ownership of the data does belong to the creator   said Rometty 
It comes as China  where the forum was held  is also looking to bolster personal privacy regulations following a series of missteps by leading tech firms including search firm Baidu Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd payment affiliate Ant Financial 
 China has become increasingly more aware of this problem and have been enforcing the relevant laws more definitely and strongly   said Baidu chief Robin Li at the same event on Monday 
 I think the Chinese people are more open  or less sensitive about the privacy issue  If they are able to trade  privacy  for convenience  safety or efficiency   in a lot of cases they are willing to do that   said Li 
In January a consumer group from Jiangsu in east China filed a lawsuit against Baidu claiming the firm was illegally collecting personal data

Our report that a political firm hired by the Trump campaign acquired access to private data on millions of Facebook users has sparked new questions about how the social media giant protects user information 
Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm hired by President Trump s 2016 election campaign  gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users  The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior 
Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  and Stephen K  Bannon  a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name  It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
On Monday  a British TV news report cast it in a harsher light  showing video of Cambridge Analytica executives offering to entrap politicians  A day later  as a furor grew  the company suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix 
The data  a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times  included details on users  identities  friend networks and  likes   The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook  and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads 
Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app  which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends  activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned 
The technique had been developed at Cambridge University s Psychometrics Center  The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica  but Aleksandr Kogan  a Russian American psychology professor at the university  was willing 
Dr  Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica 
He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  said Christopher Wylie  a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica s data harvesting  Only about 270 000 users   those who participated in the survey   had consented to having their data harvested  though they were all told that it was being used for academic use 
Facebook said no passwords or  sensitive pieces of information  had been taken  though information about a user s location was available to Cambridge 
Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was  not a data breach  because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes   and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account 
But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred  to any ad network  data broker or other advertising or monetization related service   It says that was exactly what Dr  Kogan did  in providing the information to a political consulting firm 
Dr  Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica 
Cambridge Analytica officials  after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data  changed their story last week  In a statement to The Times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed Dr  Kogan for violating Facebook s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago 
But the data  or at least copies  may still exist  The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained 
The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015  when it learned that Dr  Kogan s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica  violating its terms of service  it removed Dr  Kogan s app from the site  It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed 
Facebook also said   Several days ago  we received reports that  contrary to the certifications we were given  not all data was deleted  We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims  If true  this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made  We are suspending SCL Cambridge Analytica  Wylie and Kogan from Facebook  pending further information  
In a further step  Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm  to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists   It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr  Kogan had given a verbal commitment  while Mr  Wylie  thus far has declined  
Facebook  already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news  is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica  Investors have not been pleased  sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday 
 The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement to keep users  data private 
  In Congress  Senators Amy Klobuchar  a Democrat from Minnesota  and John Kennedy  a Republican from Louisiana  have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook s links to Cambridge Analytica  Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee  led by John Thune of South Dakota  wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected 
  A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr  Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook s ties to Cambridge Analytica 
  The attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation   Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica   she said in a Twitter post  Facebook s lack of disclosure on the harvesting of data could violate privacy laws in Britain and several states

The gates  which have a traditional shape and structure  are closely related to the Shinto religion  Typically located at the entrance of shrines or in spots that hold special religious significance  they signal a transition from the profane world to the sacred  By walking through the torii  one has entered the world of the Kami  or Shinto gods 
The earliest documentation of the torii in Japan dates to 922  during the Heian period 
The structure of the torii varies  but the most important parts are the pillars  hashira   the lintel placed on the two pillars  kasagi  and a tie beam that keeps the structure together  nuki  
For the easier puzzles at the beginning of the week  the word might appear with the clue   Shinto temple gateway  or  Shinto gateway  
Later in the week  it might be referred to as   Shinto shrine entrance    Traditional Japantown feature    Decorative gateway in Japan  or  Japanese portal

Ella McCallion woke up at 2 a m  on Monday  Oct  10 when she smelled smoke 
Ms  McCallion and her then fiancé  Jasper Smith  both 27 and from Portland  Ore   were staying at a friend s property in Sonoma  Calif   where they were planning to host 100 of their friends and family that coming Saturday  After a day of preparations  they fell into a fitful sleep to the sound of loud  gusting winds  Until Ms  McCallion woke up  She quickly shook Mr  Smith awake and looked out the window  Due east  the hills were glowing orange 
Ms  McCallion was witnessing the beginning of the record breaking wildfires that have torn through California s wine country over the last week and a half  As of Monday  at least 5 700 buildings have been destroyed  and 41 people have died  And 40 000 people had been evacuated 
Planning a destination wedding is stressful enough  but having your nuptials disrupted by a rare weather event  whether it be an earthquake  hurricane  flood or wildfires  can wreak havoc on the most well laid plans   even for couples whose weddings are several weeks  or months  away 
Ms  McCallion  a buyer at MARCH  a kitchen  and pantry ware store  and Mr  Smith  whose wedding was only four days away  had hoped that they could stick with their original plans  even as they drove south toward San Francisco  Their wedding night was to include a grill cooked  family style dinner and a jazz band that would play  Sway  for their first dance 
 We hoped that  within a day  things would be smoky and unpleasant but O K    said Mr  Smith  the owner of Son of Man Cider  a cidery in Cascade Locks  Ore 
It wasn t 
Knowing when to make the call to change  or cancel ceremonies  was just one of the tough decisions these couples and others have had to make over the last several weeks as unpredictable wildfires and hurricanes caused disruptions to their best laid plans 
Mr  Smith and Ms  McCallion were quick to praise their original venues and vendors  which have offered full refunds  nearly across the board  And they are keeping their troubles in perspective 
 People are losing their homes  We have 100 people who are traveling to celebrate us   Mr  Smith said   We re not doing so badly  
Putting together a backup plan helped  Mr  Smith and Ms  McCallion showed off their favorite parts of San Francisco  while still capturing the dinner party spirit of their original wedding  The two had a family only ceremony at San Francisco s City Hall on Friday  Oct  13   Married on Friday the 13th  under a blood red sun   Mr  Smith wryly noted   followed by oysters and champagne at Land s End  a city park with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge  Guests then gathered at their new reception hall   a private room at Hong Kong Lounge  a lauded dim sum restaurant and a favorite of the couple s when they lived in San Francisco  Mr  Smith  arm around his bride  toasted his guests   You all made our Plan B feel like a Plan A   The couple and their guests then moved down the street to Trad r Sam  where the jukebox loudly played  Sway  as the bride and groom held each other close 
Suits were pressed  the cake topper packed and all was a go for Bill Siegfried s and his partner  Greg Stockbridge s  Aug  26 destination wedding  The New York couple planned to board a Carnival cruise ship docked in Galveston  Tex   say their vows before about 90 guests  and surprise everyone with a flash mob dance to Styx s  Come Sail Away With Me   before cutting the cake and setting sail with their closest family and friends to Cozumel  Belize and the Honduras  A rehearsal dinner in Mr  Siegfried s hometown Sugar Land was set for Friday 
But an unexpected guest crashed their wedding  A Category 4 hurricane 
As Hurricane Harvey swirled closer to the Texas coast at the end of August  Mr  Siegfried  a 40 year old program director for Hearst  and his fiancé  a 43 year old personal trainer and group fitness instructor for the Y M C A   grew uneasy  From their Sugar Land hotel room the day before the wedding  they watched as airlines canceled flights and weather predictions grew dire   That morning  Greg looked up from the news coverage and said   We need a Plan B    Mr  Siegfried said 
 We didn t have time to get upset   we just went into attack mode   Mr  Siegfried said  He worked on securing space for the wedding at a Brazilian restaurant they had considered for the rehearsal dinner  which had a large enough space to accommodate guests already in town  Mr  Stockbridge bought up the roses  gladiolas and any other pink or purple flower he could find at the grocery store  mobbed with people buying canned food and water  A friend hunted down a two tiered wedding cake  And by five o clock  with Mr  Stockbridge s sister officiating  they were exchanging vows  toasting their marriage and dancing the flash mob before 49 guests  as the first gusts of wind and rain arrived 
Extensive damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria  which devastated several islands in the Caribbean  has forced numerous brides and grooms to rethink their weddings that were scheduled into the winter months  Some resorts on the islands of Anguilla  St  Barth s  St  Maarten and St  Thomas will remain closed through December  maybe later  to complete repairs 
 Even the couples who think of everything can t prepare for this level of stress   said Joann Gregoli  a New York based destination weddings planner who started a Facebook page called Hurricane Irma Crashed My Wedding to help brides and grooms replan their big day at no charge  That so many couples choose hurricane season to have their wedding may be surprising  even if it s often highly discouraged in the Caribbean  said Teresa Brunner  a wedding planner with Tropical Destination Management in the Turks and Caicos  But a fall wedding has become fashionable  According to an annual survey of 13 000 brides and grooms by the wedding website the Knot  September and October are the most popular months to get married  even more so than June  which has been the traditional favorite 
Ms  Gregoli says she and her clients were glued to the Weather Channel as recent hurricanes passed over the Caribbean islands  A few brides with upcoming weddings called her in tears   When I saw the second storm  I just kept thinking   This can t be happening     Ms  Gregoli said 
Brittany Christian and her fiancé  Marcus Benedict  weren t sure if their Sept  30 wedding would go on in the Turks and Caicos until the day before they were set to board a flight to the ceremony  When the Minneapolis couple booked their destination wedding at Beaches Turks   Caicos Resort Villages   Spa last year  they knew they set the date during hurricane season  but enticed by the promise of crystalline waters  a white sand beach and the low odds that a hurricane would hit the weekend of their wedding  they took a gamble  Hurricane Irma hit the island three weeks before the wedding  At first  the couple relied on the Beaches fan page for updates as they fielded  nonstop  calls from friends and family trying to figure out if the wedding would go on as planned   It was like having a second full time job   said Ms  Christian  28  a premium sales manager for the Minnesota United Football Club 
The couple relaxed when the resort announced that they would remain closed until Sept  21  reopening just in time for their wedding  But a week later  Beaches amended the original statement  saying they would be closed through December 2017  Ms  Christian and Mr  Benedict began scrambling 
The resort had already notified the couple that they could rebook at another Beaches property  and they d nearly settled on the Bahamas  even planning the time and place of the ceremony and picking the food all over again  when a second hurricane  Maria  picked up strength in the Caribbean  making that resort less of a sure thing  too  Plus  they wanted their wedding in Turks and Caicos  As luck would have it  an executive at the Shore Club  a luxury boutique resort in the Turks and Caicos  contacted them  He d heard their wedding was in limbo and offered to personally help them reschedule it at the luxury boutique resort  even discounting some rates  But after a few days of planning   the time and place of the ceremony  what they d serve at the wedding   it became clear the property was just too expensive 
By then  it was Saturday  the wedding was a week away and the couple still didn t have a venue  or anything to tell guests   I threw up my hands and started bawling   Ms  Christian said   I couldn t help but wonder  Is this a sign  Are we not supposed to get married  
That night  while she was working  Mr  Benedict  a director of distribution for Target  called every property in the Turks and Caicos  quickly learning that Seven Stars Resort was open and accepting guests   It became Turks or bust   he said 
They negotiated a block of rooms for guests  signing the final contract on Tuesday evening  and at 6 a m  the next day  they boarded the flight to the island   If we can get through this   Mr  Benedict said   we can get through anything  
When Sasha Garfield  30  and her fiancé  Colin McDonald  31  who live in Newport  R I   scheduled their wedding on the remote island of Cuttyhunk  a 1 5 mile spit of land off the coast of Martha s Vineyard in Massachusetts  they never dreamed that the place where Ms  Garfield spent her placid summers growing up would end up in the path of a hurricane  But in September  Hurricane Jose  a Category 1 storm  pushed wind and rain bands offshore the week of their wedding  The remnants of the storm were powerful enough to cancel ferries to Martha s Vineyard and Nantucket 
The situation proved perilous to Ms  Garfield  a consultant at the Education Advisory Board  a best practice research and technology firm in Washington  and Mr  McDonald  a vice president of Platinum Equity in New York  because everything for the wedding had to be shipped in by ferry   food  drinks  chairs  tables  cutlery  even a tent large enough to accommodate the 155 guests  Lucky for them  wind directions made it possible for most ferries to travel to Cuttyhunk  despite some big rollers  leaving passengers on the deck soaked  two ferries were canceled and those guests bunked up at local hotels on the mainland until the following morning 
The faraway hurricane challenged them in other ways  too  On the morning of the wedding  they had to find a new place for the wedding tent  which may not have withstood the strong winds in its original spot  they set up a new location just few hours before the ceremony  While some brides stress about seating charts  Ms  Garfield says she was more worried about having enough food  and guests  arriving on ferries  Still  the wedding happened on time that Saturday with all 155 guests in attendance  the rain stopping and the sun emerging minutes before the ceremony 
 We always knew having the wedding on Cuttyhunk introduced a lot of risk and variables   Ms  Garfield said   but we also knew  no matter what  it would be worth it  
SAN FRANCISCO   Facebook said on Thursday that it would end an experiment in six countries that separated posts from news sites and publishers from other material on the social network 
News organizations in the countries   Slovakia  Sri Lanka  Cambodia  Bolivia  Guatemala and Serbia   had said they were blindsided by the Facebook experiment when it began in October and complained that it had led to a surprising rise in misinformation 
Facebook stopped short of acknowledging that the changes made in the experiment  called Explore  contributed to that increase in misinformation  but the company said it could have done a better job communicating with publishers about what was happening 
 In surveys  people told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing  and having two separate feeds didn t actually help them connect more with friends and family   Adam Mosseri  who heads Facebook s News Feed  said in a statement posted online   We also received feedback that we made it harder for people in the test countries to access important information  and that we didn t communicate the test clearly  
Facebook and other social media companies are grappling with their role in spreading false information propagated by Russians ahead of the 2016 presidential election  And they face increasing pressure from regulators around the world to get a better handle on what happens on their networks  from misinformation to cyberbullying 
Also on Thursday  Jack Dorsey  the chief executive of Twitter  said his company was looking for ways to measure the  health  of conversations on Twitter 
In a series of tweets  Mr  Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter has been home to a number of people who use the platform to harass  bully and mislead 
 We have witnessed abuse  harassment  troll armies  manipulation through bots and human coordination  misinformation campaigns  and increasingly divisive echo chambers   Mr  Dorsey wrote   We aren t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service  or our inability to address it fast enough  
After Facebook released Explore in the six countries  it was quickly criticized by independent news sites and nongovernmental organizations  The changes  they said  made it harder for trusted sources of information to reach local populations  They also said the experiment had led to an increase in false and salacious news being shared in those countries 
Stuart White  editor of The Phnom Penh Post  an English language newspaper in Cambodia  said traffic from Facebook to his site had plummeted because of the changes to Facebook s main News Feed   the scrolling stream of content that greets people when they log into the social network 
The experiment took place during a crackdown by the country s leader  Hun Sen  on political opponents  activists and media  effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one party state  Journalists were arrested  and newspapers were shut down  Facebook had emerged as an important  more independent channel for information 
 Whether or not Facebook likes it  it has established itself as the main market for news in places like Cambodia   Mr  White said   It would be helpful if they acknowledged that responsibility  
Fabiola Chambi  the web editor of Los Tiempos  the main newspaper of the Bolivian city of Cochabamba  said Explore had reduced traffic to the site by 30 to 60 percent  Ms  Chambi said the Explore function was a constant source of confusion for publishers and readers who thought their access to news had been the subject of an experiment by a foreign company 
 It wasn t an idea that was ever well received  and garnered plenty of rejection   she said   And I would guess this had something to do with their decision to reverse course  
However  the move did force the newspaper for the first time to think about life after Facebook   We had to confront the declines and in the end found some creative ways to improve traffic and maintain a loyal audience   Ms  Chambi said 
Facebook s role as a kingmaker among publishers has played a central role in a debate over the responsibilities that social media companies have to police content on their own platforms 
Facebook has announced a series of changes to its News Feed as it looks to increase  meaningful interaction  on its site by drawing attention to content from family and friends while de emphasizing content from brands and publishers  Those changes will be introduced gradually around the world 
Facebook has said those News Feed changes were not related to Explore  but there are similarities in the way the company is looking to play down material from publishers 
While Facebook has said it was emphasizing meaningful interactions  Mr  Dorsey said Twitter was determined to find  holistic and fair solutions  to its problems 
The company recently rewrote its user rules and guidelines  and has begun punishing well known Twitter users who violate those rules by removing their  account verification  status or barring them altogether 
It was unclear how either Twitter or Facebook will measure the new method by which they said they will judge their platforms  or how they will affect the billions of people who use them 
I don t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media 
You ve probably experienced it yourself  Maybe it s the way you feel while scrolling through your Twitter feed   anxious  twitchy  a little world weary   or your unease when you see a child watching YouTube videos  knowing she s just a few algorithmic nudges away from a rabbit hole filled with lunatic conspiracies and gore  Or maybe it was this month s Facebook privacy scandal  which reminded you that you ve entrusted the most intimate parts of your digital life to a profit maximizing surveillance machine 
Our growing discomfort with our largest social platforms is reflected in polls  One recently conducted by Axios and SurveyMonkey found that all three of the major social media companies   Facebook  Twitter and Google  which shares a parent company with YouTube   are significantly less popular with Americans than they were five months ago   And Americans might be the lucky ones  Outside the United States  social media is fueling real world violence and empowering autocrats  often with much less oversight  
But it would be a mistake to throw up our hands and assume that it has to be this way  The original dream of social media   producing healthy discussions  unlocking new forms of creativity  connecting people to others with similar interests   shouldn t be discarded because of the failures of the current market leaders  And lots of important things still happen on even the most flawed networks  The West Virginia teachers  strike and last weekend s March for Our Lives  for example  were largely organized on Facebook and Twitter 
The primary problem with today s social networks is that they re already too big  and are trapped inside a market based system that forces them to keep growing  Facebook can t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can t stop selling coffee   it s the heart of the enterprise 
Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation  The Honest Ads Act  a bill in the Senate  would require greater transparency for online political ads  The European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  which goes into effect in May  aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails 
But these efforts don t touch the underlying problems  and in fact could make it harder for start ups to compete with the giants 
If we re really serious about changing how social networks operate  far more radical interventions are required  Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market based pressures that got us here 
In their book  New Power   which comes out next week  Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms write about the struggle between centralized  top down institutions  which represent  old power   and decentralized  bottom up movements  which represent  new power  
Facebook  they write  is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests  It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant  centralized enterprise  with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform s governance 
Instead  the authors ask  what if a social network was truly run by its users 
 If you re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence  you should share in the value you re creating   Mr  Heimans told me 
Nathan Schneider  a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado  had a similar idea in 2016  when he proposed that Twitter users band together to buy the platform from its shareholders and convert it into a user run collective  similar to the way a local credit union is run  People who made valuable contributions to the network  such as employees and power users  would receive bigger stakes and more voting power  And users would have a seat at the table for major decisions about the platform s operations 
It s exceedingly unlikely that Mark Zuckerberg  who has fought hard to keep control of Facebook  will ever convert the company into a user owned and run collective  But Mr  Schneider believes that giving more control to responsible users could help restore trust in the network  and signal the kind of values Mr  Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to represent 
 He could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby   Mr  Schneider said 
Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email   so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another  across a common protocol 
Instead of one big Facebook  a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes   Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook   all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense  Rather than requiring a one size fits all set of policies that apply to billions of users  these nodes could be designed to reflect users  priorities   A network for privacy hawks and one for open sharing maximalists could have different data retention rules  and a network for L G B T  users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules   If a node became too toxic  it could be removed without shutting down the entire network 
 Email is the most resilient social network on the internet   Mr  Schneider said   and the thing that allows it to adapt is that it s an open protocol  and people build apps on top of it  and we evolve how we use it  
Versions of this kind of network already exist  Mastodon  a decentralized Twitter like social network  has gotten more than a million registered users since its debut in 2016  And various social networks based on the blockchain   the ledger system that underlies virtual currencies like Bitcoin   have sprung up in recent months 
To be sure  decentralized networks have their own problems  They re messy to administer  and they can still be gamed by bad actors  They can also fall prey to the same kind of privacy issues that Facebook is being criticized for   In fact  part of the reason users are angry at Facebook right now is that the company s data infrastructure was too open  and made it overly simple for third party app developers to take user information outside Facebook  
None of this is a panacea  But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests  rather than those of a faceless corporation 
A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid  Tinder and Bumble wasn t the way they were designed or the companies behind them   it was how long they had existed 
New apps  she said  were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates  Older apps  by contrast  were eventually overrun with creeps and predators  no matter how well built they were 
A similar theory might apply to social networks  Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years  but they were by and large cleaner  with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior  Today  the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors  and many of our  social graphs    Facebook s term for the webs of digital connections we create   are clogged with years  worth of clutter 
In a blog post last year  the venture capitalist Hunter Walk proposed an interesting idea  a legally mandated  start over  button that  when pressed  would allow users of social networks to delete all their data  clear out their feeds and friend lists  and begin with a fresh account 
I d go even further  and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic  self cleaning  option  which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used  friendships and followers they no longer interacted with  and data they no longer needed to store  If these tools were enabled  users would need to take affirmative action if they didn t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years 
Making social graphs temporary  rather than preserving them forever by default  would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks  business models  But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene  and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded  It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks  when things were fresh and fascinating  and not quite so scary 
OSLO   Sylvi Listhaug s anti immigration views and sharp comments have made her one of Norway s most polarizing political figures  but it was a single  incendiary Facebook post that has threatened to bring down the government and led to her resignation as justice minister on Tuesday 
Ms  Listhaug and her right wing Progress Party  which is a junior partner in a fragile coalition  supported a bill that would have allowed the government to strip Norwegian citizenship from those suspected of joining terrorist or foreign militant groups  without a court hearing  After the bill was defeated earlier this month  she lashed out online 
In a Facebook post  which she has since taken down  she said the center left Labor Party  believes the terrorists  rights are more important than the nation s security   and attached a photo of two veiled and gun toting fighters from the Shabab militant group in Somalia  thousands of miles away 
That hit a nerve in a country with still raw memories of its worst terrorist attack in modern times  in which Labor members were the targets  In 2011  a far right  anti Islam extremist  Anders Behring Breivik  detonated a bomb outside a building housing offices of the government  then led by Labor  killing eight people  and then went to a Labor youth camp on Utoya island  where he shot dead 69 people  most of them teenagers 
The Facebook post  which coincided with the premiere of a film about the 2011 massacre  set off an escalating social media war between Ms  Listhaug s supporters and her foes  as she first refused to back away from it and then apologized repeatedly 
The post drew likes and shares from Ms  Listhaug s anti immigrant political base  and a far right Facebook group orchestrated the delivery of piles of flowers to the Justice Ministry  But it also attracted outraged reactions and prompted an online campaign asking people opposed to her to contribute to the charitable group Doctors Without Borders  The effort raised its target figure of 15 million kroner  about  1 94 million  in a matter of days 
 I can t recollect any other incidents in northern Europe where social media has created a cabinet crisis of this magnitude   said Eirik Loekke of Civita  a center right political think tank 
Opposition parties called a vote of no confidence in Ms  Listhaug in Parliament  which could have threatened Prime Minister Erna Solberg s governing coalition  Ms  Listhaug resigned as justice minister just as that vote was about to begin 
 This saves the government   said Lars G  Svasand  a political scientist at the University of Bergen 
Ms  Solberg s center right Conservative Party leads a minority coalition alongside the populist Progress Party and the more centrist Liberal Party  The prime minister elevated Ms  Listhaug to the justice post in January  in an attempt to co opt and moderate the hard line anti immigrant populists 
Norway is often ranked as having one of the world s most democratic and stable political systems  and in the past  minority coalitions have managed to govern through quiet pragmatism and compromise 
But Ms  Listhaug  40  who rose to prominence as a social media firebrand  has struck out against that kind of cozy consensus  in a way that has fueled her rapid rise and fall 
She gained an early taste for politics as an intern at the Republican Party in the United States  before moving into a career alternating between national politics and lobbying 
She has been in government since 2013  first catching attention as an outspoken agriculture minister who took on small farmers and reindeer herders from the country s indigenous Sami minority by cutting back subsidies  And she has stridently criticized other lawmakers from rival parties  including accusing the leader of the Christian Democratic Party  Knut Arild Hareide  of  licking the back of Imams  
In a Facebook post announcing her resignation on Tuesday  Ms  Listhaug dismissed the controversy around her as a  witch hunt   and expressed a willingness to carry on as a lawmaker in Parliament  vowing to speak freely come what may  The Progress Party leader  Siv Jensen  remained optimistic about Ms  Listhaug s prospects  saying that her career had  only just begun  
Espen Teigen  an adviser to Ms  Listhaug who is often cited as a driving force behind her social media strategy  also announced his resignation on Tuesday 
In a Facebook post of his own  Labor s current leader  Jonas G  Store  welcomed Ms  Listhaug s decision to step down 
 This case started with a Facebook post that never should have been published   he wrote   We cannot have a minister of justice who brings wood to the fire of hatred and conspiracy theories  
NEW DELHI    India has set a March 31 deadline for London based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to respond to a query on whether it was engaged to improperly harvest Facebook data on Indian citizens  the information technology ministry said 
India s information technology minister last week warned against any abuse of social media in elections  following reports that the analytics firm improperly accessed information on millions of Facebook users to target U S  voters 
Friday s notice to the firm followed local media reports that Indian political parties had used the data analytics firm during elections 
India is preparing for a general election in 2019 and several states will elect new assemblies this year and the next 
 The fairness of Indian democracy and electoral process is a matter of pride and any attempt to influence the sanctity of the electoral franchise through dubious and questionable means is unacceptable   the ministry said in a statement 
Attempts by Reuters to seek comment from the firm  via social media  went unanswered 
The ministry raised six questions in its notice  from whether the firm had engaged in profiling based on the data collected  to how the data was used and if consent had been secured from the concerned individuals 
The government was deeply concerned with allegations that data could have been used to influence people s behavior  the ministry said 
The ministry has threatened to take legal action against companies and individuals engaging in any unauthorized use of such data

Stocks tumbled on Monday  dragged down by shares of technology companies  which until recently had propelled the nine year bull market ever higher 
Facebook was at the heart of the sell off  Its shares closed down 6 8 percent after news emerged over the weekend that a political data firm with links to President Trump s 2016 campaign had harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles 
The news reports could open the door to greater government scrutiny and potential regulation of the technology sector  Already  government officials in the United States  Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world s largest tech companies  That  in turn  could erode the industry s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models 
Facebook s decline on Monday was the stock s worst single day fall since 2014  and it weighed on the other tech giants  Google s parent company  Alphabet  fell more than 3 percent  Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1 7 percent  And Apple  the largest American company by market capitalization  sank 1 5 percent 
The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market  with the Standard   Poor s 500 index down 1 4 percent  The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1 8 percent 
The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil  After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets  equities have been on a roller coaster since February  The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected 
Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009  technology companies have delivered total returns   including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid   of more than 570 percent  far outpacing the broader market  In 2009  the tech sector made up 17 5 percent of the S    P  500  Today  that figure is more than 25 percent  meaning that a swing in tech stocks has a big effect on the broader market 
A few giant companies have been the driving force behind the rally  Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Google s parent company   often referred to in the markets by the shorthand FANG   have become a favorite combination for stock investors

LONDON    Facebook is co operating with Britain s Information Commissioner s Office  ICO  as it examines how 30 organizations have used personal data  but the ICO said on Thursday it was too early to say whether the social media giant had done enough 
On Wednesday  Facebook said the personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  more than previous estimates 
The ICO said it was looking at how data was collected from a third party app on Facebook and shared with Cambridge Analytica  as well as a broader investigation into how social media platforms have been used in political campaigning 
 Facebook has been co operating with us and  while I am pleased with the changes they are making  it is too early to say whether they are sufficient under the law   the information commissioner  Elizabeth Denham  said in a statement 
 As part of my investigation into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns  parties  social media companies and other commercial actors  the ICO is investigating 30 organizations  including Facebook

SAN FRANCISCO   In 2014  Russians working for a shadowy firm called the Internet Research Agency started gathering American followers in online groups focused on issues like religion and immigration  Around mid 2015  the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages  A year later  they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States 
Their digital instrument of choice for all of these actions  Facebook and its photo sharing site Instagram 
The social network  more than any other technology tool  was singled out on Friday by the Justice Department when prosecutors charged 13 Russians and three companies for executing a scheme to subvert the 2016 election and support Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  In a 37 page indictment  officials detailed how the Russians repeatedly turned to Facebook and Instagram  often using stolen identities to pose as Americans  to sow discord among the electorate by creating Facebook groups  distributing divisive ads and posting inflammatory images 
While the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing  it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election  Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times  while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less  Twitter was referred to nine times  YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times 
It is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States  The indictment further batters Facebook s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity 
Jonathan Albright  research director at Columbia University s Tow Center for Digital Journalism  said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country 
 Facebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U S  and figure out how to manipulate us   Mr  Albright said   Facebook  essentially  gave them everything they needed   He added that many of the tools that the Russians used  including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes  still pervade Facebook 
Facebook  with more than two billion members on the social network alone  has long struggled with what its sites show and the kind of illicit activity it may enable  from selling unlicensed guns to broadcasting live killings  The company s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites  which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers 
When suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome  Mark Zuckerberg  the company s chief executive  dismissed the concerns  But by last September  Facebook had disclosed  that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot button issues through the company  It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram 
The resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook s reputation  Company officials  along with executives from Google and YouTube  were grilled by lawmakers last fall  Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S  Mueller III  the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference  It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate s name goes through a more stringent vetting process  Mr  Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors 
Yet Facebook s multiple mentions in Friday s indictment renew questions of why the world s biggest social media company didn t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it  How effective the company s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear 
Rob Goldman  Facebook s vice president of advertising  waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election  On Saturday  President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory 
In Silicon Valley  where Facebook has its headquarters  some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public 
 Mueller s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016   said Roger McNamee  a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook   In its heyday  television brought the country together  giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences  Facebook does just the opposite  enabling every user to have a unique set of facts  driving the country apart for profit  
Joel Kaplan  Facebook s vice president of global policy  said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action  against those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process  
He added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place   We know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks   he said 
Facebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors  Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel s investigation 
YouTube did not respond to a request for comment  while Twitter declined to comment  PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and  is intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services  
According to the indictment  the Internet Research Agency  created in 2014 in St  Petersburg and employing about 80 people  was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes 
The group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014  when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion  Over the next two years  the indictment said  the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media  The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America  Blacktivist and Secured Borders 
By 2016  the indictment said  the size of some of these Russian controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers 
The Russians then used these groups to push various messages  including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr  Trump or his opponent  Hillary Clinton  In October 2016  according to the indictment  one Russian controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying   Hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary  We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils  Then we d surely be better off without voting AT ALL  
Around 2015  according to the indictment  the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter  targeting specific communities within the United States  The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts  spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach 
In one ad  published to promote a Facebook event called  Down with Hillary   an image of Mrs  Clinton was shown with a black  X  painted across her face  The text read   Hillary Clinton is the co author of Obama s anti police and anti Constitutional propaganda  
By mid 2016  according to the indictment  the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States  That June  for example  posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook  they promoted a rally called  Support Hillary  Save American Muslims   For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook  the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs  Clinton in a prison uniform 
At every step  the Russians used Facebook s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible  Those tools allowed them to get real time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers 
Researchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation  it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively 
 They re taking steps to fix this  but there s no easy solution   Anton Vuljaj  a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups  said of Facebook and other social media companies   This also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online  
SHANGHAI   Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook s chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  arguing that he mischaracterized his company s effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country 
Taking aim at comments Mr  Zuckerberg made in a recent interview  the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar  The same problems keep recurring  they said  with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions 
In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week  Mr  Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year  One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims  expected on Sept  11  The other  spread among Muslims  cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date 
 So that s the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm   Mr  Zuckerberg said   Now  in that case  our systems detect that that s going on  We stop those messages from going through  
In an open letter  the organizations  which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content  including the chain letters  said the messages had spread for days  caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents 
They also said there was no system at all  only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol 
 In your interview  you refer to your detection  systems   We believe your system  in this case  was us   and we were far from systematic   the letter says   From where we stand  this case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation  It reveals an overreliance on third parties  a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation  a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency  
Facebook responded to the criticism in a satement on Friday   We are sorry that Mark did not make clearer that it was the civil society groups in Myanmar who first reported these messages   it said   We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content  We should have been faster  and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive  hateful or false content  
Myanmar highlights existential questions about Facebook s mission and responsibilities  The site has closely connected people in the country   in many cases  Facebook is the only online service they use  It has also become a major channel for the spread of hate speech and propaganda that has encouraged and obfuscated ethnic cleansing of the country s Muslim Rohingya  according to human rights groups 
Almost 700 000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last summer  when the military started a crackdown in the country s western Rakhine State  Last month  United Nations investigators said Facebook played a role in spreading hate speech that incited violence against the Rohingya 
For Mr  Zuckerberg  the timing of the letter is bad  Both he and his top deputy  Sheryl Sandberg  are making multiple media appearances this week to address questions about how the company handles users  personal data  The company has faced harsh criticism for reports on how information about millions of users may have been improperly leaked to a political consulting firm connected to President Trump s 2016 campaign 
The criticism has sent the company s stock tumbling  Next week  Mr  Zuckerberg is expected to appear at multiple congressional hearings 
Among the half dozen signatories of the letter posted on Thursday in Myanmar are Phandeeyar  a leading technology hub in the country that helped Facebook draft its Burmese language community standards  Myanmar ICT for Development Organization  which monitors online hate speech  and the Center for Social Integrity 
The letter lists what the groups say are several problems with Facebook  It says the company lacks adequate tools to report messages that might incite violence  It also says Facebook failed to provide channels for organizations to communicate with data and engineering employees who might have been able to devise solutions to the problems 
 Presumably  your data team should be able to trace the original sources of flagged messages and posts and identify repeat offenders  using these insights to inform your moderation and sanctioning   the letter says 
Jes Petersen  chief executive of Phandeeyar  said problematic messages in Myanmar were not a one time problem 
 There s multiple cases of similar things that have happened where we ve done everything we can to bring it to Facebook s attention but we don t see much happening on their end   he said   That s a big part of the problem  
Victoire Rio  a social media analyst in the country who previously worked at Phandeeyar  said another major issue was Facebook s lack of Burmese speakers for local monitors to communicate directly with 
 It s evident to us that there are not enough resources and not enough human resources dedicated to Myanmar   Ms  Rio said  She added that the company s Burmese speaking reviewers were based in Dublin  and from the company s recruiting pages it seems it is struggling to find qualified candidates 
The groups also faulted Facebook s lack of transparency  They said that after they had reported the messages that Mr  Zuckerberg cited in his interview  they heard nothing from the company about what happened or how Facebook would better respond 
 I was seriously concerned and looking for anyone I could   Ms  Rio said   I was surprised to hear that Mark had been contacted about this fairly quickly  the use of strong language was effective  
As the Mets and Phillies faced off at Citi Field on Wednesday  they also played the role of guinea pigs in a new Major League Baseball experiment  participating in its first digital only national broadcast 
The game was shown on Facebook  which partnered with M L B  to exclusively produce and broadcast 25 games this season as part of baseball s efforts to appeal to a younger audience and tap into fans  online discussions 
The Mets Phillies game was the first of the 25 games set to be aired on Facebook   one per week   and the early feedback was largely negative  Fans quickly voiced their displeasure with the newfangled broadcast and its glitches  and not just because they couldn t watch their teams as they normally would  the Mets on SportsNet New York and the Phillies on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia 
Several viewers complained that the onscreen scoreboard and statistics banner blocked too much of the screen  as did the comments bar on the side  And in the fifth inning  as the broadcast showed a montage of the Mets  oft injured captain David Wright  the feed froze 
Much like any new way of viewing sports  this debut broadcast appealed to some fans and estranged others 
 I m standing in my kitchen watching on my cellphone because it wasn t working well on my TV   Mike Schulman  a high school teacher on Long Island  said by telephone during the ninth inning of the Mets  4 2 victory   It worked but it was lagging  The image got really pixelated at points  It worked fine on my cellphone and laptop  
Some lag time could be attributed to the speed of viewers  internet connections or cellphone data  but the glitch in the fifth inning on Facebook Watch  as the platform s video service is called  was a widespread technical problem  It was quickly fixed 
 We re still in the early days of having live sports on Facebook Watch and are learning with every broadcast we have on the platform   a Facebook spokesman said in a statement   Fortunately  we have a great partner in Major League Baseball innovating on our platform and listening to feedback from fans to adjust the broadcast in real time  
M L B  added in a statement   Today marked a historic and important step as we experiment with new platforms for fans to watch games  Our fans provided great feedback throughout their experiences today  which will continue to help us as we present these social first broadcasts on Facebook each week  
The viewing experience for the Mets Phillies game was certainly different  Instead of the traditional commercial breaks in between half innings  there were short segments about players and teams  and interviews with Mets pitcher Matt Harvey and the comedian Jim Breuer  a Mets fan  At times during game action  a viewer s comment would be highlighted on a banner across the top of the screen 
 I know they re trying to bring in a new audience  but I don t think that s the best way to bring them in   Schulman said 
After receiving many complaints  producers of the stream told viewers how to hide the comments bar via the comment section  as well as on the broadcast itself  They also reduced the size of the onscreen graphics  which were originally designed for cellphone screens 
Of the big four professionals sports leagues in the United States  M L B  has the audience that skews the oldest  A study by Magna Global  a marketing research company  found that the average age of television viewers of M L B  in 2016 was 57 
Schulman considers himself to be part of the target audience for M L B   he is 30 years old and a die hard fan of the Mets  His television wasn t compatible with the Facebook app  but he figured out how to use a different streaming device 
Although he and his 60 year old father are Facebook users  Schulman said his father struggled to load the game  so he had to walk him through directions on the phone during the game   For me it was fine  but for an older man or woman who is not as tech savvy  might be more difficult   Schulman said 
Nearly 69 000 comments streamed across the bar on the side of the viewing screen  They ranged from harsh criticism to compliments for the teams and players  as well as complaints about the broadcast and even about privacy concerns facing Facebook  Viewers said they were watching from as far away as Sweden 
 Watching on the train in Queens NY  Loving this   wrote one viewer 
 Why did syndergaard leave early   asked another 
 Worst viewing experience ever   a different viewer said 
M L B  first aired a handful of games on Facebook last year  using the local broadcast s feed on the social media platform  Last month  M L B  announced that 25 games this season would be produced by MLB Network and its broadcasters solely for Facebook Watch  joining a wave of new broadcasting efforts in live sports by companies like Twitter and Amazon  Facebook reportedly paid over  30 million for the games 
The deal means that fans who usually tune in to their local regional cable network or have purchased M L B  s smartphone At Bat app or MLB TV service cannot watch the 25 Facebook broadcast games there 
The attendance and ratings are usually lighter for a midweek day game early in the season  and the hour and forty five minute rain delay on Wednesday most likely didn t help  The Mets announced a paid crowd of 21 328 people  At one point  over 80 000 viewers watched the Facebook broadcast 
Next week  the St  Louis Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers will get their turn on Facebook 
SAN FRANCISCO    Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that the personal information of up to 87 million users  mostly in the United States  may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica  up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million 
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call with reporters that Facebook had not seen  any meaningful impact  on usage or ad sales since the scandal  although he added   it s not good  if people are unhappy with the company 
Shares rose more than 3 percent after the bell 
Zuckerberg told reporters that he accepted blame for the data leak  which has angered users  advertisers and lawmakers  while also saying he was still the right person to head the company he founded 
 When you re building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world  there are going to be things that you mess up   Zuckerberg said  adding that the important thing was to learn from mistakes 
He said he was not aware of any discussions on the Facebook board about him stepping down  although directors would face a challenge if they wanted to oust him because Zuckerberg is the controlling shareholder 
He said he had not fired anyone over the scandal and did not plan to   I m not looking to throw anyone else under the bus for mistakes that we made here   he said 
Facebook first acknowledged last month that personal information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica 
Zuckerberg will testify about the matter next Tuesday and Wednesday during two U S  congressional hearings 
London based Cambridge Analytica  which has counted U S  President Donald Trump s 2016 campaign among its clients  disputed Facebook s estimate of affected users  It said in a tweet on Wednesday that it received no more than 30 million records from a researcher it hired to collect data about people on Facebook 
Zuckerberg  on the call with reporters  said Facebook should have done more to audit and oversee third party app developers like the one that Cambridge Analytica hired in 2014 
 Knowing what I know today  clearly we should have done more   he said 
Going forward  he said  Facebook was taking steps to restrict which personal data is available to third party app developers  and he said it might take two more years to fix Facebook s problems   https   bit ly 2Ejpktb 
 We re broadening our view of our responsibility   Zuckerberg said 
Most of the up to 87 million people whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica were in the United States  Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a blog post   Graphic  https   bit ly 2q5r5pl 
Shares in Facebook closed down 0 6 percent on Wednesday to  155 10  They have tumbled more than 16 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke 
The previous estimate of more than 50 million Facebook users affected by the data leak came from two newspapers  the New York Times and London s Observer  based on their investigations of Cambridge Analytica 
Zuckerberg said Facebook came to the higher estimate by looking at the number of people who had downloaded a personality quiz app created by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan  or about 270 000 people  and then adding in the number of friends they had 
Cambridge Analytica has said that it engaged Kogan  in good faith  to collect Facebook data in a manner similar to how other third party app developers have harvested personal information 
The scandal has kicked off investigations by Britain s Information Commissioner s Office  the U S  Federal Trade Commission and by some 37 U S  state attorneys general 
Nigeria s government will investigate allegations of improper involvement by Cambridge Analytica in that country s 2007 and 2015 elections  a presidency spokesman said on Monday

On most days  Facebook doesn t have much in common with President Trump  But at the moment  both are in the damage control business  as they try to get out from under the cloud of suspicion related to Russia s meddling in the 2016 election 
Their goals collided in awkward fashion over the weekend when Rob Goldman  Facebook s vice president of advertising  posted a series of messages on Twitter that were meant to clear up misconceptions about Facebook s role in the election  Instead  he plunged the company deeper into controversy 
 Most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election   Mr  Goldman tweeted   I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was  NOT  the main goal  
He continued   The majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election  We shared that fact  but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn t align with the main media narrative of Tump  sic  and the election  
Mr  Goldman was tweeting only for himself  but his comments  which drew praise from other Facebook executives on Twitter  were an unusually candid statement that flouted Facebook s well sculpted messaging strategy  which has generally been to stay as far away from partisan debates as possible  The tweets arrived soon after the blockbuster indictment of Russian nationals by the special counsel Robert S  Mueller III  and they were noticed by right wing partisans  who saw them as supporting evidence for Mr  Trump s  no collusion  claims  Soon  Mr  Trump himself had retweeted them approvingly 
Mr  Goldman eventually walked back some of his statements  but it was too late  Mr  Goldman had just given Mr  Trump something that looked like a Facebook stamped exoneration 
Now  Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off message executive  while clarifying that it didn t mean to bolster the president s position 
 The special counsel has issued its indictments  and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions   Joel Kaplan  Facebook s vice president of global policy  said in a statement   Any suggestion otherwise is wrong  
Mr  Goldman did not respond to requests for comment  and the company declined to make him available for an interview 
It is Facebook s right to defend itself  of course  The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing  some of which have indeed been overblown  Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia s Internet Research Agency  the company at the heart of Mr  Mueller s indictment  And other companies  such as Twitter and YouTube  certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish 
But Mr  Goldman s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing  It showed that  years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public  some high ranking officials within the company still don t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia s misinformation campaign  and how consequential the company s mistakes have been   Last year  in a tweet that fewer people saw  Andrew Bosworth  another Facebook vice president  claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were  marginal  even in a close election   
In real world terms  a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed  rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes  and no alarms or locks on the doors  and then acted surprised when burglars struck 
Even before Mr  Goldman s tweets were blasted along to Mr  Trump s 48 million followers  they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr  Mueller s investigation had found  He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts  He claimed that swinging the election in Mr  Trump s favor was not a primary goal of Russia s Facebook campaign  when Mr  Mueller s indictment had just concluded that it was  He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation  when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators  and has deliberately hidden data about Russia s interference from outside researchers 
Some of Mr  Goldman s claims may have been narrowly true  but they were a prime example of misdirection  Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation  as Mr  Goldman suggested  rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth  Why should it reassure us that most of Russia s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election  rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem 
More than anything  the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor  None of the safeguards it has announced so far   such as providing more transparency about political ads  or using snail mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers   would stop a sophisticated and well funded foreign influence operation  And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016   including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co conspirators   would be just as effective today 
In a recent cover story  Wired detailed the soul searching journey that Facebook s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election  First  they denied that they d done anything wrong  Then  after the scope of Russia s misinformation campaign became clear  they circled the wagons to protect the company s reputation and appease its critics  Only recently have certain executives  like Mark Zuckerberg  its chief executive  come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook s errors  and publicly accept responsibility for them 
We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016  and why it didn t act more forcefully to stop it   Trust me  I ve tried   But it s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms  as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world  some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes  fixing their platform s problems and protecting our democracy 
WASHINGTON   When the message from Matt Skiber arrived in the mailbox of the Facebook account for Donald J  Trump s Florida campaign in early August 2016  it raised no flags  despite its slightly awkward attempts at colloquial American English 
It was one of thousands of inquiries about getting involved   in this case asking for the campaign s support in planning  a YUGE pro Trump flash mob in every Florida town    that were fielded by an overextended staff that was mostly new to presidential politics 
The campaign employee who oversaw the Facebook account took more than two weeks to get back to Mr  Skiber  according to private Facebook messages obtained by The New York Times  The employee  who did not want to be remembered as the victim of a Russian plot and asked for anonymity  thanked Mr  Skiber for his enthusiasm and creativity and recommended that he contact Chad Tucker  the Florida communications director  at his campaign email address  Adding a thumbs up and American flag emojis  the employee told Mr  Skiber   We can win this  
But Mr  Skiber was not an American supporter of Mr  Trump  Instead  he was a persona created by the Internet Research Agency  the Russian company indicted last month  The special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  alleged that the company  linked to President Vladimir V  Putin of Russia and his country s intelligence services  executed an elaborate and expensive plot to  sow discord  in American politics and ultimately to boost Mr  Trump and damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign 
A review of the private Facebook messages  as well as interviews with the Trump campaign operatives who were targeted by Russians  reveal that Mr  Trump s team was susceptible to Moscow s interference campaign  It preyed on unsuspecting staff members who were more interested in capturing the enthusiasm of supporters of their unorthodox nominee and did not envision the seemingly far fetched possibility that Russians might enlist them as unwitting players in a scheme to undermine American democracy 
 Nobody reasonably would have asked   or even thought to ask    Are you sure you re not with Russia    said Karen Giorno  a Republican operative who was the Florida state director for Mr  Trump s campaign at the time it was contacted by the Internet Research Agency   It s just not something that normally you would think you have to watch out for  
In a plot carried out by 80 employees  the Internet Research Agency  which has come to be known as the  troll factory   stole identities from Americans and created social media campaigns and fake online personas like Matt Skiber to try to manipulate voters  activists and Trump campaign staff members  court papers show  The Russians focused on Florida  the nation s most critical swing state  contacting activists and Mr  Trump s campaign primarily for help in staging rallies across the state on Aug  20  in the heat of the presidential race  called Florida Goes Trump  according to the indictment 
Court papers do not indicate whether the Russians succeeded in winning help from the campaign s Florida operation  And the rallies appear to have attracted few attendees and relatively little attention at the time 
The Trump campaign s operation in Florida  as in many key states  was thinly staffed  inexperienced and often overwhelmed by the demands of a white hot presidential race  Any procedures for vetting and verifying people or groups who sought to get involved were not widely shared by campaign staff members  And they were generally not on the lookout for infiltration efforts by anyone  let alone by Russians who had gone to great lengths to create false identities 
The informal setup and small staff was typical of the on the ground operations of most statewide or presidential campaigns  which tend to be chaotic hives of activity where offers of volunteer assistance are usually welcomed with little scrutiny 
 I would have been more concerned with whether or not the opposition would try to infiltrate our campaign   Ms  Giorno said   or whether someone who was trying to represent the campaign had a criminal record  or had the right character or background  
Ms  Giorno said she was not involved in running the Facebook account and was  shocked  by the revelations in the indictment that someone on her staff had unknowingly opened the door for the Russians 
But  she added   I don t know how you stop that  Anybody can put up a fake profile on anyone  
The Trump re election campaign did not respond to a request for comment  Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  said   Out of respect for the special counsel  we are not going to comment  
The employee who oversaw the Facebook account had wide latitude and focused primarily on policing for offensive content on the public facing portion of the page  while also trying to respond to everyone who privately expressed an interest in boosting Mr  Trump 
The employee cited a desire to be polite to supporters and to make them feel heard  Expressing embarrassment over being tricked by the Russians  the employee compared the situation to  The Americans   the television show in which Russian spies collect intelligence while passing themselves off as business owners in Washington during the height of the Cold War 
Using the information provided by the employee  the Russians at the Internet Research Agency emailed Mr  Tucker  the campaign s Florida communications director  from an account set up under another alias  Josh Milton  court documents show  The Russians presented the Milton persona as the  team leader  of a pro Trump social media group called Being Patriotic  according to a Facebook message 
Being Patriotic had planned rallies in 13  confirmed locations  in Florida and asked the campaign for help at each one  the Russians using the Josh Milton email address wrote to Mr  Tucker  according to the indictment 
Days later  on the recommendation of the campaign employee operating the Florida Facebook account  the Russians contacted another campaign staff member  Beatriz J  Ramos  who served as the coalitions director for the Trump campaign in Florida  according to the indictment  which does not identify either Mr  Tucker or Ms  Ramos by name 
Mr  Tucker and Ms  Ramos said that they received a high volume of messages during the campaign  and had no recollection of receiving  let alone responding to  the messages  Both said they could not recall any messages that prompted suspicions about Russian outreach  though they acknowledged they were not attuned to that possibility  either 
 No one was talking about the Russians back then  so it s not like something that anyone was looking out for   said Mr  Tucker  adding that his job did not include vetting volunteers or communicating with people who wanted to set up rallies  He worked for Mr  Trump s presidential transition after the election and is now a telecommunications official based in South Carolina 
Ms  Ramos  who briefly worked for the Trump administration before returning to Florida  suggested that Mrs  Clinton s allies might have tried to frame the Trump campaign   I ve been around long enough to know that if Democrats are blaming Republicans for something  they ve already done it  and they ve done it worse   she said   So I feel like maybe your questions are best directed to someone from the Hillary campaign  rather than myself  because I ve not seen anything that would represent any type of collusion or any Russian influence  
Ms  Ramos and Mr  Tucker said they could not check their campaign email accounts because they no longer had access to them  The messages sent by the Russians via Facebook are no longer accessible from the Trump campaign s Florida account  the employee said  because the Matt Skiber account from which they were sent was deactivated 
According to the indictment  the Russians deleted social media accounts and emails  in order to avoid detection and impede investigation  once it became apparent that Mr  Mueller s team was working with Facebook and other social media companies to investigate Russian interference  Mr  Mueller s team did collect at least some of the Facebook messages and emails sent to the Trump campaign officials in Florida 
The dates of the Facebook messages obtained by The Times roughly correspond to those referenced in the indictment 
Mr  Mueller s investigators likely would have emails sent by the Trump staff in response to the Russian entreaties  the special counsel requested and received documents from the campaign  which instructed former staff members to retain all documents and communications related to the campaign 
Mr  Tucker  Ms  Giorno  Ms  Ramos and the employee who sent the Facebook messages said they had not been contacted by the special counsel 
 We were never notified or aware of any Russian efforts to interfere in the election by the F B I  or any other agency   Ms  Giorno said   As someone who worked very closely with then candidate Trump  I can tell you that security and integrity of the process was paramount to him and his senior staff  
The ability of campaigns to detect and prevent foreign infiltration could be tested again soon  Intelligence agencies and outside experts agree that Russians are planning to meddle in elections this fall and beyond  but Mr  Trump and key parts of his administration are doing little to combat such meddling 
SAN FRANCISCO   Ryan Knight  a Democratic activist in Los Angeles  called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn t responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming video service after the Parkland  Fla   school shooting 
 Dear  Apple   Mr  Knight wrote on Twitter   Your silence is deafening   BoycottApple   More than 330 accounts retweeted the message 
How did Mr  Knight post the message  He used an iPhone 
As the reach and influence of Silicon Valley s tech giants have increased  so have the calls to boycott their products and services  The problem is that pulling off a boycott is not exactly easy  The tech companies  products are so pervasive that they are difficult to avoid 
That issue was crystallized in recent weeks with Facebook  Hundreds of people deleted their accounts after revelations that the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users  Yet many of those same people promptly instructed their friends to find them on Instagram  which is owned by   you guessed it   Facebook 
 It s exactly the same company  I realize it s ridiculous   said Sachi Cunningham  a documentary filmmaker in San Francisco who deactivated her Facebook last week and shifted her attention to Instagram  where  she said  the conversation is less toxic 
Ms  Cunningham  who has freelanced for The New York Times  added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries   I don t know if I can get out of the ecosystem   she said 
People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them  After Google fired an engineer  James Damore  for criticizing the company s diversity efforts last year  hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company  But an analysis of nearly 7 000 tweets using the hashtag  BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google s Android software  according to Keyhole  a social media research firm 
One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug  8   Google s firing of James Damore proves his point completely  I will no longer be using Google for any services   BoycottGoogle   The tweet came from an Android device  A message to the account went unreturned 
Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma  The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices   and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook  Breitbart didn t respond to a request for comment 
Marisa Richardson  a program manager at a life sciences company  said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming video service  So when she needed laundry detergent  she avoided the e commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic   and spent a few dollars more   at a nearby Target 
But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland  Calif   I completely forgot that they re owned by Amazon   she said 
After the shooting in Parkland in February  gun control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel 
People used the hashtag  March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media  An analysis of about 58 500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad  according to Keyhole  Those included popular tweets using the  March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano 
 Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone  the same issue would apply  There is an NRATV app for Android phones   Ms  Milano said through a spokeswoman   We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies  but also our lives in the most in depth way imaginable  
Nearly a third of the 4 700 tweets using the  BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones  according to Keyhole 
 I do have an iPhone  but as a customer of Apple s  am I not allowed to hold them accountable   Mr  Knight  the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott  said in an interview 
Eddy Cue  a senior executive at Apple  recently said that the NRA channel didn t violate the company s policies  Facebook  Google and Amazon didn t respond to requests for comment 
Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company s orbit  not only with Instagram but also with the company s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger 
When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page  she said on Twitter   2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me   But her Instagram account  with 768 000 followers  was still active 
Likewise  Elon Musk  chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla  deleted the Facebook pages of both companies   but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram  The photo sharing platform  he said on Twitter  is fine  so long as it stays fairly independent  
Stephen Cox  39  a woodworker in Los Angeles  recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram  When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company  he replied   It s a double edged sword  but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other  
Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site  While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016  according to a January survey of 2 002 American adults by the Pew Research Center  Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period  Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people  according to the survey 
Rayven Bruzzese  26  a sign language student in Philadelphia  said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time  Now she spends her time on Instagram 
While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook owned service  she said her options were limited  Few of her friends are on Twitter  and many have stopped using Snapchat 
 Where am I supposed to go   she said   I wish there was something else  
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives  Hanna Ingber  editorial director of The Times s Reader Center  discussed the tech she s using 
The Reader Center collects story ideas and feedback on our coverage from readers  What have been the most important tech tools for engaging with our audience 
We use a variety of tools to listen to our readers and respond to them  We need that variety because readers are talking about our coverage on so many different platforms   our own site  Twitter  Facebook and more  Plus  there are readers contacting us directly by email and phone  We even received a letter in the mail   which I promptly Instagrammed 
Twitter can be very useful for quickly knowing how readers are reacting to our coverage  but it s also very noisy  The social media dashboard Tweetdeck makes a big difference  I set up columns that help me sort through the high volume of tweets and find the ones that are most important to me  For example  I have a column that shows me every time a tweet mentioning The New York Times is getting a lot of attention 
Facebook is also crucial to our work  We can use it to get feedback on our coverage and reach out to our readers  asking them about the news or their communities 
One of my colleagues on the Reader Center  Josie Sedgwick  wanted to know what the long winters are like for our readers who live around the Arctic Circle  She put together a series of questions using an in house tool called Formacist  and then posted that on Facebook  targeting readers who live in countries in that region  She was hoping to hear from maybe a dozen readers  she heard from 700   And their responses were breathtaking  
Facebook Live enables us to have candid and accessible back and forth discussions between our journalists and our audience  A recent thought provoking example was a Race NYT chat with hosts John Eligon and Rachel Swarns discussing adoptions that cross racial and ethnic lines 
We also use email  and the comments system on our site  Plus  our colleagues send us interesting or useful feedback they spot through our Reader Center Slack group 
And then there s text message  My brother in law happens to be very good at spotting criticism of our coverage that is bubbling up on Twitter and probably will deserve our attention  On the weekends  when I am less active on Twitter  he s my early warning system 
What could be better 
Many of our colleagues wish they had a better sense of what our readers are saying about their coverage  There is a lot of feedback to keep up with and sort through  We d love to have a tool that would enable us to aggregate reader feedback  emails  social media posts  comments and more  in a faster and more systematic way 
You ve invested time in coming up with creative ways to use social media  What are some of your favorite uses of social media sites like Twitter  Facebook  Snapchat or Instagram  
I appreciate Twitter when reporters bring us along on a journey  telling a story with their tweets  Rukmini Callimachi  our correspondent who covers Islamist extremism  took her followers along as she traveled with an embed into western Mosul  for example  introducing us to villagers and showing us what she saw 
When Julie Turkewitz  a national correspondent  traveled with a group of students from Parkland  Fla   to the state capital to demand more gun control  she tweeted scenes from the bus along the way  Her tweets were gripping and immediate  and they gave us a window into a scene we couldn t have otherwise gotten 
Twitter is also an indispensable tool for journalists and just about anyone else to be part of a conversation about the news as it s unfolding 
While journalists are on Twitter  the bulk of our readers are on Facebook  At The Times  we regularly use Facebook to reach our readers and ask them to participate in our coverage 
I also prefer Facebook for its sense of community  Facebook groups tend to be closed  so people are writing posts to a segment of people  Perhaps because the posts are not for the wider public  there seems to be a lot less posturing on Facebook than on Twitter 
Do you have a personal favorite Facebook group 
My guilty pleasure is scrolling through the Maplewood Moms  Facebook group   I live in a neighboring New Jersey town   Local parents post questions that are incredibly relevant to my life  like how to get your toddler to brush his teeth  There are discussions on managing a commute and bedtimes  and horror stories of lactation rooms that don t lock 
Even though I don t know all of the mothers  or even most of them  I feel a sense of shared values and experiences  We can so easily relate to one another  battling toddler meltdowns and long waits at the pediatrician s office  And this leads to an online environment that feels both intimate and supportive 
What other tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life 
I tried the Apple Watch and could barely figure it out  So I ll say my phone  an iPhone 7 with a maroon and purple case  
My entire life exists on my phone  For nonwork purposes  I love that I have a camera and video recorder with me wherever I am   crucial for a parent of young children 
I do my banking  listen to podcasts  read  and jot down funny things my 4 year old  Isaac  says  And I wrote out these answers on my phone  in the Notes app  while getting my hair cut 
Smartphones now also make for easy house stalking  I love going to a dinner party and then checking out the person s home on Zillow  My husband and I often play a game to guess how much we think the house sold for   Life in the suburbs is underrated  
In our own home  our kids love using our Amazon Echo  Isaac asks it all sorts of important life questions  like  Alexa  do you like bubbles     He also orders up his favorite songs  then he and his little brother dance around the kitchen 
I wish there were a feature on my phone that could make it quickly obvious to others what I am doing on it  I grew up watching my parents read the newspaper over breakfast  I wish that when I was reading the news  my kids could tell  Instead  they just see my head in my phone  That is the major reason I still get the Sunday paper 
LONDON    A scandal engulfing Facebook over the use of its data by political consultants widened on Tuesday when a whistleblower said Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed a program to target Republican voters in the 2016 U S  election 
Christopher Wylie  who previously revealed that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had accessed the data of 50 million Facebook users to build voter profiles on behalf of Donald Trump s campaign  said AggregateIQ  AIQ  had built software called Ripon to profile voters 
Wylie was giving evidence to a British parliamentary committee over the scandal  minutes after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declined to appear before the legislators to discuss what went wrong 
The head of the committee called Zuckerberg s decision  astonishing  and urged him to think again 
CNN said Zuckerberg had decided to testify before the U S  Congress 
The revelations around Facebook data have hammered the stock price of the world s biggest social network and raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation 
 There s now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon  which is the software that utilized the algorithms from the Facebook data   Wylie told the British Parliament s Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Committee 
Facebook is facing intense scrutiny after Wylie s revelations about improper use of personal data and the role that could have played in the 2016 U S  election 
Zuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes Facebook had made and promised tougher steps to restrict third party access to such information 
Ripon  the Wisconsin town where the Republican Party was founded in 1854  was the name given to a tool that let a campaign manage its voter database  target specific voters  conduct canvassing  manage fundraising and carry out surveys 
AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks  The company previously told Reuters that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica 
Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ 
The Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Tuesday that it has contacted its counterpart in British Columbia to discuss the provincial office s review of AggregateIQ 
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING
With the scandal around Facebook widening  Britain s cross party media committee had invited Zuckerberg to parliament to explain how personal data had ended up in the hands of  Cambridge Analytica  the London based political consultancy which was working on the Trump campaign 
The company said he had asked one of his deputies to attend the hearing in London  suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject 
 These issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position   wrote Rebecca Stimson  head of public policy  Facebook UK 
 As such Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the committee  
Damian Collins  the head of Britain s media committee  asked the company to rethink   Given the extraordinary evidence that we ve heard so far today    it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning   he said 
Wylie was also quizzed on the use of data in the 2016 Brexit referendum  which has become a hot topic in Britain 
Whistleblowers have has said the main campaign for leaving the EU broke the law on spending limits by spending money with another Brexit campaign group that it was closely affiliated with  a claim denied by senior Brexit campaigners 
Vote Leave denies any wrongdoing

Several years ago  a plastic figurine began appearing around Google s offices  an aging alien with gray hair  a Google Glass headset and a sign that read   Get Off My Lawn  
The doll  a special edition of Google s Android mascot  was a jokey tribute to the Greyglers  a group for the 40 and over crowd at Google  and the doll hinted at how it felt to be an older worker in tech  funny  self conscious  a little out of place 
The Greyglers still exist  but they re no longer such an anomaly  Sundar Pichai  Google s 45 year old chief executive  would fit in the group  So would Larry Page and Sergey Brin  who co founded the search engine as graduate students two decades ago  Susan Wojcicki  an early employee who runs YouTube  and most of the company s other high ranking executives 
For years  the self appointed leaders of Silicon Valley were young people   mostly men   with age appropriate behavior  They adopted brash mottos like  move fast and break things  and eschewed work life balance in favor of all night hacking sessions in offices that looked more like college dorms  Their successes were cheered  and their sins were shrugged off as the cost of innovation 
 Young people are just smarter   Mark Zuckerberg crowed back in 2007  when he was the 22 year old wunderkind behind a fledgling social network 
Now  of course  Facebook is a global powerhouse  and the company s pursuit of growth at all costs has led to some truly dire consequences around the world and fueled a larger backlash against tech  At the same time  Mr  Zuckerberg has disproved his own theory  Now 33  he is still not old by any measure  except perhaps his own   But he is a smarter and more self aware leader than he was a decade ago  and he has shown more willingness to accept responsibility for the company s mistakes  After years of moving fast and breaking things  Facebook is at least acknowledging its flaws and trying  albeit clumsily  to fix them  That s a start 
There s a lot of growing up happening in today s tech industry  where former whiz kids made their fortunes and are now settling down  starting families and starting to think about their legacies  Tech s work force remains young   according to PayScale  the median employee at the five largest tech companies is around 30  roughly a decade younger than the median American worker   but the industry s leaders have gotten older  and are seemingly more attuned to the power they wield 
 Five years ago  there was no talk of empathy or moral responsibility   said Om Malik  a venture capitalist who has written about the tech industry for years 
Certain corners of the start up world  such as cryptocurrency ventures  are still filled with reckless renegades  But the industry s largest companies are now mature  bureaucratic businesses whose daily decisions are heavily scrutinized  That s a good thing  since the issues many of these companies now face   global information wars  regulation and privacy concerns  diversity and sexual harassment challenges  and worries about technology s effects on billions of people s brains   will require thoughtful  grown up solutions 
In recent weeks  I spoke to numerous industry insiders about this coming of age  Here s what I learned 
Tech leaders are becoming more realistic and introspective 
Gregor Hochmuth  33  an early engineer at Instagram  said some of today s internet giants had grown up with positive thinking cultures that left them vulnerable to abuse 
 The idea that a product could make your life worse was not in anyone s perception   said Mr  Hochmuth  who left Instagram in 2014 
That perspective helps explain the shock many founders felt when the internet grew into the foundation of global culture and commerce  and products they had built as quirky experiments became pieces of critical infrastructure 
 No one was thinking about  Wow  in 15 years  billions of people are going to be using this site every day    said Andrew McCollum  34  one of Facebook s founders  who left the company in 2006 and is now the chief executive of Philo  an internet TV company   The goal was  How do we create something great     not  What s our plan for world domination   
Twitter  another company started by young idealists  is the latest tech giant to put itself under the microscope  In a series of tweets early this month  Jack Dorsey  Twitter s chief executive  said the company was trying to improve the health and civility of its platform after years of neglect 
 We didn t fully predict or understand the real world negative consequences   Mr  Dorsey  41  wrote   We acknowledge that now  and are determined to find holistic and fair solutions  
You could chalk these statements up to self interest  But Maureen Taylor  a leadership communication expert who frequently coaches tech executives  said this kind of earnest self examination was becoming more frequent among founders 
 As you get older  you realize your responsibilities are bigger   she said   People are becoming very thoughtful about the ramifications of technology  and remembering that the whole point was to make the world a better place  
Their new outlook is making them more protective and risk averse 
The tech industry s stereotypical accessory used to be the hoodie  Today  it might as well be the Baby Bjorn  There are a lot of new parents among tech elites  including Mr  Zuckerberg and Kevin Systrom  34  a co founder of Instagram   Evan Spiegel  the 27 year old chief executive of Snap  is expecting his first child this year   And parenthood seems to be shaping their attitudes  In an interview with The New York Times this year  Mr  Zuckerberg cited his children as one of the reasons he was so focused on fixing Facebook 
 It s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world   Mr  Zuckerberg said 
Chamath Palihapitiya  41  an early Facebook executive who now leads the venture capital firm Social Capital  told me that becoming a father had transformed his outlook on technology  He avoids screen time for his children  and is more wary of the tools he helped build 
 Before fatherhood  I believed that enabling my children to grow and explore through technology would be an obvious edge and something I d support   Mr  Palihapitiya said   Increasingly  what I see is a detached generation of kids living behind screens  
As their executives pursue personal growth  some of Silicon Valley s large companies are also professionalizing their workplaces by cutting back on frivolous perks and enforcing stricter rules on sexual harassment and other forms of employee misconduct   You could call this the  Uber effect   
Industries run by older executives aren t necessarily paragons of virtue  either   See  Wall Street   But there is something to be said for caution  and tech companies now seem aware that they re playing with live ammunition 
 You become more responsible when you have more to lose   Mr  Malik said 
It also may make their companies more vulnerable 
Silicon Valley works a bit like a forest   as old trees decay and die  they decompose and fertilize the next generation of growth  And today s largest tech companies are beginning to show their age  Facebook is 14 years old  and Twitter is 12  Google  at 20  is now nearly as old as Microsoft was in 1998  when Google was started 
The tech industry s maturity may be a sign of cyclical renewal  Fifteen years ago  Larry Ellison   the billionaire co founder of Oracle  and the enfant terrible of an earlier generation of tech moguls   denounced what he saw as Silicon Valley s slow footed stagnation   The tech industry was  as large as it s going to be   he predicted  
Mr  Ellison was wrong  of course  Tech wasn t stagnant  but the generation of mature companies that included Oracle was on its way to being eclipsed by newer and scrappier ventures 
If history is any indication  that cycle will repeat itself and a new crop of young tech leaders will emerge  But hopefully they ll learn from the mistakes made by their predecessors  Technology is too important now  and we can t afford another generation of naïveté 
LONDON    British Prime Minister Theresa May said she hoped Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg understood why people were concerned about alleged leaks of personal data  but it was up to him to decide whether to face a committee in Britain s parliament 
 Mr Zuckerberg will decide for himself whether he wants to come before the committee  but what I hope  is that Facebook will recognize why this is so significant for people and why it is that people are so concerned about it  and ensure that the committee is able to get the answers that they want  May told lawmakers 
British lawmakers said earlier on Tuesday they still wanted to question Zuckerberg after the company said it would send another executive to appear before them

LONDON   Beware the bonhomie 
That s just one way of advising playgoers to be on their guard at  Girls   Boys   the solo play from the Tony Award winning writer Dennis Kelly   Matilda   that finds the performer Carey Mulligan in cheerfully chatty mode   for the first stretch  at least  The production  which runs through March 17  brings Ms  Mulligan  an Oscar nominated actress  back to the Royal Court Theater for the third time 
Ms  Mulligan s unnamed character is dryly funny on any number of topics  from the vagaries of fate   I got Southampton   she says with regard to picking a travel destination at random  to airport etiquette and a job interview that she recollects in painstaking  bitterly comic detail  throwing in a fart joke for emphasis  It s easy to imagine knocking back a beer or two with her and emerging chums for life 
Listen carefully to her words  however  and you may notice an underlying aggression  At that interview  for instance  Ms  Mulligan speaks of her potential employer  sizing me up  like a psychopath weighing up which ear to cut off first  
So it s not a complete surprise when events take a shivery twist   There are also hints in the director Lyndsey Turner s ultraslick production  and in the thanks proffered by Mr  Kelly in the published text to Euripides  among others  
For much of the time  Ms  Mulligan stands before us  like a chicly coifed if barefoot comedian eager to corral an expectant audience  Those scenes are interlaced with domestic encounters with two children  who remain unseen but nevertheless seem to demand every reserve of energy that this quick witted  expletive prone woman can muster 
The vignettes draw upon Ms  Mulligan s unheralded gifts as a mime artist   suddenly  she must play an entire family   and come with a visual commentary  At various moments  the set from Es Devlin crackles into brightly vivid life  only to revert in an instant to the neutered  anesthetizing look that pervades throughout   Ms  Devlin and Ms  Turner  the director  are frequent  and invaluable  collaborators  
Visual contrast is missing from this landscape  Something else is missing  as well  though to elaborate would result in an unforgivable spoiler  What can be said is that the Ms  Mulligan we see at the close of the uninterrupted 90 minutes has an altogether different aspect from the freewheeling raconteur seen at the start  Rather like the American playwright Neil LaBute  who has traversed comparable terrain in such plays as  Bash  Latter Day Plays   Mr  Kelly addresses humankind s capacity for violence at every turn  Not even the children are exempt 
So far so good  if so depressing  though hardly more so than the world at large  But not content to leave well enough alone  Mr  Kelly dresses up his narrative in ways that detract from its power  like some overzealous puppeteer  More than once  there is the sort of rhetorical question    Does that make sense     that in the theater tends to make me queasy  lest an overeager audience member reply  And I m not sure we need the reminder that this grievous tale represents only one side of the story  Since when did the theater become a courtroom requiring equal time for all 
If the play overreaches for effect  there s no trace of the sensational in Ms  Mulligan s performance  which is accompanied by a playfulness and quick wittedness that bypass the gathering thesis mongering of the final passages   You can t help but feel that Mr  Kelly devised his play in order to corroborate a grim statistic that s mentioned near the end    Girls   Boys  may work from the outside in  but it s blessed with an actress whose integrity anchors a play that  without her  might well seem a sleekly oiled con 
For a stage monologue cut from less flashy  but more honest  cloth  try  The B easts   written and performed by Monica Dolan  Running at the Bush Theater in West London through March 3  the 65 minute production from the director John Hoggarth focuses on Tessa  a fortysomething psychotherapist who reports not altogether dispassionately on a case to which her character has a saddening personal connection 
The moral inquiry on view involves a mother who has facilitated breast implants for her 8 year old daughter amid a hypersexualized culture that  in the language of the play   wants you to want   Moving on to embrace the dark web  the depredations of Facebook and a society in which the phone has  become a human right   Ms  Dolan proves as exacting an authorial commentator as she is a compelling stage presence  Forever leaning into the audience so as to gain our confidence  her Tessa becomes our guide in a world that gives genuine cause for alarm 
I would be remiss not to commend  and how   a third splendid actress   this one a visitor to the London stage  Marylouise Burke has long been a New York theater stalwart  and she has now crossed the Atlantic as the lone American performer in the National Theater premiere of Annie Baker s ravishing and mysterious  John    The production in the Dorfman auditorium finishes March 3  
Playing the landlady of a Pennsylvania boardinghouse filled to bursting with tchotchkes   if only there were tours of Chloe Lamford s set    Ms  Burke presides with abiding sweetness over both the  quarrelsome  couple who have come to stay and the play itself  Her character  Mertis  pulls open the floor length curtains at the start  welcoming us into some gently otherworldly realm  The bows at the end are staged as if in an opera house  and snippets from Offenbach s  The Tales of Hoffmann  prove crucial to the climactic scene 
Amid an impeccable four person ensemble  Ms  Burke is a league apart   not just for a fluty voice possessing cadences all its own  but also for her caress of Ms  Baker s signature flourishes  As directed by James Macdonald  the production is nowhere more moving than in Ms  Burke s enumeration of the various collective nouns for birds that include  an exaltation of larks   By the end of the play s riveting three and a half hours  with two intermissions   it is we who are among the exalted  having been in the presence of a performer who is an absolute one off  on either side of the Atlantic

NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO    Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U S  privacy laws  according to a Reuters Ipsos poll released on Sunday  illustrating the challenge facing the social media network after a scandal over its handling of personal information 
The poll  taken Wednesday through Friday  also found that fewer Americans trust Facebook than other tech companies that gather user data  such as Apple Inc  Alphabet Inc s Google  Amazon com Inc  Microsoft Corp and Yahoo 
Some 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to obey laws that protect their personal information  compared with 66 percent who said they trust Amazon  62 percent who trust Google  60 percent for Microsoft and 47 percent for Yahoo 
The Reuters Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States  It gathered responses from 2 237 people and has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of 2 percentage points   Graphic  https   tmsnrt rs 2pA8DoG

Facebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week  while the hashtag  DeleteFacebook gained traction online and the company s chief executive officer  Mark Zuckerberg  faced demands that he appear before U S  lawmakers to testify in a hearing 
Zuckerberg and Facebook s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg  said last week that shoring up trust was their priority   We know this is an issue of trust  We know this is a critical moment for our company   Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday 
It is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook  eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said  Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith  she said 
 It s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that s become pretty well ingrained into people s lives   she said 
One reason that Facebook and other internet companies collect personal information from users is to deliver advertisements for products and services to people who are most likely to want them 
Facebook  with more than 2 billion monthly active users  made almost all its  40 6 billion in revenue last year from advertising 
The poll found that many people take a dim view of those  targeted  advertisements 
Some 63 percent said they would like to see  less targeted advertising  in the future  while 9 percent said they wanted more  When asked to compare them with traditional forms of advertising  41 percent said targeted ads are  worse  while 21 percent said they are  better  
 I think they make a lot of assumptions that are not true   poll respondent Maria Curran  56  who lives near Manchester  New Hampshire  said in a follow up interview 
 It s like if I show an interest in healthy eating  all of a sudden all of the ads are about weight control and exercise and how to lose weight  I just get inundated   she said 
Curran said she knows online retailer Amazon com also collects her information for targeted marketing  but that it is less annoying because it is a shopping site  not a place for personal conversations 
Another poll respondent  Kamaal Greene  26  said he likes targeted ads better than traditional ones because they provide a service  steering him to products he wants 
 A while ago I was looking for a special kind of glove for my job   said Greene  a firefighter from Detroit 
 I put it in my Amazon cart and forgot about it  Then  later  the ad popped up on     Facebook  and I was like  oh shoot   It reminded me and I clicked on it and bought it  
A plurality of adults said they would like the government to take a bigger role in overseeing the industry s handling of user information  According to the poll  46 percent of adults said they want more government regulation  while 17 percent said they want less  Another 20 percent said they wanted no change  and the remaining 18 percent said they did not know

WASHINGTON   Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook  Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive  Mark Zuckerberg  to testify before them  Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about  50 billion in the past two days 
They are all focused on the same thing  whether Facebook mishandled users  data 
Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users  selling advertisements based on their ages  interests and other details  But the scrutiny over the company s vast trove of personal data   following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users   is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula 
 Investors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation   said Brian Wieser  a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group   The scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems  
So far  most of the social network s top executives have been silent  Mr  Zuckerberg  its founder  and Sheryl Sandberg  his top deputy  have not made any public statements in recent days  The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park  Calif   where the company is based 
At the meeting  employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica  The firm  which was tied to President Trump s 2016 campaign  used the data to target messages to voters 
The meeting  which included Facebook s deputy counsel  Paul Grewal  largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers  according to Facebook employees in attendance  Mr  Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday  when the company holds an all hands meeting 
The company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it  The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos  Facebook s chief security officer  who plans to leave in August 
The pressure on Facebook has been building for years 
It started in the European Union  where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region s 500 million people  The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators  Europe has approved a new privacy law  which takes effect in May  that will give users of Facebook  Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them 
After the 2016 presidential campaign  lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics  citing the company s role in Russia s disinformation efforts  The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news  and the company s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future 
The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers  The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users 
The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission  which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency  according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry 
The F T C  investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third party apps on the social media site  like games  would not be allowed to access their data  But the apps  the agency found  were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user 
The current investigation has parallels  The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  Mr  Kogan  a professor at Cambridge University  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends  Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time 
Then  Mr  Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica  a firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon  the former White House political adviser  and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook s policies  the company said last week 
 There are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here   said David Vladeck  a former director of consumer protection at the F T C 
The company could face fines of  40 000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement 
 We are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating   an F T C  spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday   We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously  
Facebook said it expected to receive questions from the F T C  related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree   We remain strongly committed to protecting people s information   Facebook s deputy chief privacy officer  Rob Sherman  said in a statement   We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F T C  may have  
The F T C  inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash  On Tuesday  the New York attorney general  Eric T  Schneiderman  announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general  Maura Healey  in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  New Jersey s attorney general announced a similar investigation 
Mr  Schneiderman and Ms  Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica 
 Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users  personal information   Mr  Schneiderman said   Today s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened  
There have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica 
Senators Amy Klobuchar  Democrat of Minnesota  and John Kennedy  Republican of Louisiana  have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  Charles E  Grassley  Republican of Iowa  to hold a hearing  Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee  organized by John Thune of South Dakota  wrote a letter on Monday to Mr  Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties 
 It s time for Mr  Zuckerberg and the other C E O s to testify before Congress   Senator Mark Warner  Democrat of Virginia  said on Tuesday   The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election  
Facebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr  Warner  the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee  and the offices of members of other committees  including Commerce  this week 
 The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling   Mr  Thune said in his letter 
On Tuesday morning  a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr  Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company s connection to Cambridge Analytica  The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr  Zuckerberg 
 The committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site  and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent   wrote Damian Collins  chairman of the British committee   Your officials  answers have consistently understated this risk  and have been misleading to the committee

WASHINGTON   Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data  as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network s alerting users 
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data  to target political advertising and manipulate voters  
The calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica  a political data firm founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior  The firm s so called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016  though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques 
But Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested  The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states 
Damian Collins  a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country s referendum to leave the European Union  said this weekend that he  too  would call on Mr  Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify  The social network sent executives who handle policy matters to answer questions at an earlier hearing in February 
 It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers   Mr  Collins said in a statement   This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed  
The fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news  The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year  and struggled to keep public opinion on its side 
Over the weekend  Facebook was on the defensive  Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company s protections had not been breached  and that Facebook was thus not at fault 
 This was unequivocally not a data breach   tweeted Andrew Bosworth  a Facebook executive   No systems were infiltrated  no passwords or information were stolen or hacked  
The data was obtained in 2014  when Cambridge Analytica  through an outside researcher  paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends   activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew 
The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica  Alexandr Kogan  told Facebook and his app s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes  not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative  Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used 
Mr  Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr  Kogan  whose app  did not follow the data agreements  
Facebook s chief security officer  Alex Stamos  issued a similar defense in a series of tweets that have since been deleted 
 The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful  but it is incorrect to call this a  breach  under any reasonable definition of the term   Mr  Stamos tweeted 
The explanation did little  however  to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data 
 Facebook s platform must protect us from predatory behavior   wrote a Twitter user named Evan Baily   or we can t and shouldn t trust the platform  
Jonathan Albright  research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company s platform could continue to be exploited 
 Unethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few   if any   lasting repercussions   Mr  Albright said 
Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook  said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed   That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people s information   he said 
This month  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained  And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers 
There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer  especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie  a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica s data harvesting   but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations 
On Friday  Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing  the newspaper s outgoing editor  John Mulholland  said on Twitter 
Then  late Friday evening  Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak  The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Kogan and Mr  Wylie 
By then  Facebook had learned that Mr  Wylie  who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014  was a named source for the news reports 
In a statement on Sunday  Mr  Wylie described himself as  a curious and naïve 23 year old   when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica 
 I feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world   he added   I need to make amends  and that s why I m coming forward  
His lawyer  Tamsin Allen  said that last week Mr  Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data 
Now  though  Facebook said on Sunday  Mr  Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted   a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting 
In both Britain and the United States  lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports  they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it 
Mr  Collins  the British lawmaker  said he planned to call Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data 
 It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament   Mr  Collins said 
In the United States  the attorney general of Massachusetts  Maura Healey  announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation   Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica   she said in a Twitter post that linked to the Times article 
Also on Saturday  the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California   called for investigations of the Facebook data leak 
 This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users   said Mr  Schiff  who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee 
Revelations that a voter profiling company that worked Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering  What  if anything  can they do to protect their data connected to the social network 
Here s the harsh truth  Not much  short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account 
Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data  such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook 
But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data  Here s what you need to know 
An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife  which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use  About 270 000 people participated in the study   enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users 
How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270 000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party  Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it 
That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica  the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign 
There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data harvesting apps and programs  That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook  Here s a run down of what you should do 
  Audit your Facebook apps  If you used Facebook to sign in to a third party website  game or app  those services may continue to access your personal data  On Facebook  go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account  From there  you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing  Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use   Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users  
On the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use  This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps  Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don t want any of your information  like your birthday or hometown  accessed by your friends  apps 
  Audit your Facebook privacy settings  If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends  now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly  For example  you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts  or that only you can see your friends list 
  Read privacy policies  When you sign up for a new app or web tool  the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service  Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy  If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable  don t use the program 
  Install a tracker blocker  There are add ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites  But be aware that in some cases  they will make parts of websites work improperly  In our tests  Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google s Chrome browser 
Here s a primer on how tracking works  to give you a sense of why blockers are important  When you engage with an app on Facebook  it may plant a tracker in your web browser  like a cookie  that collects information from you  Even when you close out of the app  the tracker can continue to follow your activities  like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates  according to Michael Priem  chief executive of Modern Impact  an advertising firm in Minneapolis 
 It doesn t go away after you ve stopped looking at the ad   he said 
  Install an ad blocker  Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether  Ad blockers are also add ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer  Mobile ads are fully functioning programs  and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data  Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites   and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks  A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin 
  Clear your browsing data  Periodically  you can clear your cookies and browsing history  Apple  Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari  Chrome and Internet Explorer  That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers  though they will probably reappear over time 
  Be wary of unknown brands  Even if you read the privacy policies  you still may have to take them with a grain of salt  In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app  the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use  not commercial purposes  So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations   Then again  the researcher came from Cambridge University  one of the world s top schools   so who can you really trust  
SAN FRANCISCO   The contemporary internet was built on a bargain  Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share 
People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google  generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising  The companies became very rich  Users seemed happy  Privacy was deemed obsolete  like bloodletting and milkmen 
Now  the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google s free services is under siege from users  regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic  It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive  whack a mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data 
The recent revelation that Cambridge Analytica  a voter profiling company that had worked with Donald J  Trump s presidential campaign  harvested data from 50 million Facebook users  raised the current uproar  even if the origins lie as far back as the 2016 election  It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up 
That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google  At the furthest extreme  some dream of the companies becoming public utilities  More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed  although it s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous 
Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors  such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising  said Daniel J  Weitzner  director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
There are other avenues still  said Jascha Kaykas Wolff  the chief marketing officer of Mozilla  the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser  including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers 
 They are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms   Mr  Kaykas Wolff said of online marketers  This past week  Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook  saying the social network s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data 
The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies  frightened by the tumult  will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency  And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill 
The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe  where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising 
The Cambridge Analytica case  said Vera Jourova  the European Union commissioner for justice  consumers and gender equality  was not just a breach of private data   This is much more serious  because here we witness the threat to democracy  to democratic plurality   she said 
Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw  the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery 
Consumers  seemingly benign activities   their likes   could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior  And not just by unknown third parties  Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting  describing its services in a company case study as  influencing voters  
 People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters   said Alessandro Acquisti  a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University   If your personal information can help sway elections  which affects everyone s life and societal well being  maybe privacy does matter after all  
In interviews  Mr  Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg  Facebook s chief operating officer  seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation  something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago  But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad supported internet at risk 
 You re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising  reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product   said Dean C  Garfield  chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council  a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon  Facebook  Google and Twitter 
If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States  it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo  the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War 
 We re at an inflection point  when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm   said Heather Grabbe  director of the Open Society European Policy Institute   This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers  and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances  
In May  the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law  called the General Data Protection Regulation  The new rules treat personal data as proprietary  owned by an individual  and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission   opting in rather than opting out   after receiving a request written in clear language  not legalese 
Mélanie Voin  a spokeswoman for the European Commission  said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive  For example  a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue 
In a January speech in Brussels  Facebook s Ms  Sandberg said   We know we can t just meet the G D P R   but we need to do even more   Google declined to comment 
The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation  But after years of pushing for similar legislation  privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum   and they were looking to Europe for inspiration 
 With the new European law  regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools   said Jeffrey Chester  the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy  a nonprofit group in Washington   We now have a way to hold these companies accountable  
But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry 
Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status  health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior based ads  They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people 
In 2010  for instance  the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers  called Do Not Track  Two years later  the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights  intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used 
But the Do Not Track effort and the privacy bill were both stymied 
Industry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation  Instead  the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads  although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected 
 If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual company failure  then there s a case to be made for federal regulation  under certain circumstances  said Randall Rothenberg  chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau  a trade group 
The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two  Nor did people flee for other services  That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue 
If the current furor dies down without meaningful change  critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched  When the tech industry follows its natural impulses  it becomes even less transparent 
That would hamper any long term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views  an urgent question in Germany  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  the United States and many other places 
 To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook  you need to give much more access to researchers  not less   said Paul Jasper Dittrich  a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute 
There s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing  It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion  The technology world s remedy for any problem is always more technology 
 If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits  we could regulate them   said Maciej Ceglowski  who runs Tech Solidarity  a labor advocacy group   But well intentioned people can break things not easy to fix  It s like a child running a bulldozer  They don t have any sense of the damage they can do  
Is content still king 
It was Bill Gates of Microsoft who declared it so in 1996  but the proposition has been repeated so often by Disney executives that it could have served as the company s corporate slogan 
When AT T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago  Disney s chief executive  Robert A  Iger  said the deal proved yet again that  content is king  
So Disney s abrupt strategic shift just two weeks ago sent shock waves through Hollywood  Silicon Valley and the telecommunications industry  The company said it was buying 42 percent of the internet distributor BamTech for  1 6 billion  bringing its stake to 75 percent   creating its own direct to consumer streaming service  and severing its lucrative licensing deal with Netflix for Disney branded content in the United States 
 Is the network   the platform   now most important   asked Michael Olson  the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray  when we spoke last week 
The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution   in whatever form it takes   is a low margin commodity  and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming  who can sell to the highest bidder 
In keeping with that philosophy  Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property  acquiring Pixar   7 billion   Marvel Entertainment   4 billion  and Lucasfilm   4 billion   Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders 
But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast  Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution   and a potential new revenue source 
There s no question that the internet generally  and Netflix specifically  upended the traditional content distribution supply chain and caused profound changes in the entertainment industry  As The New York Times reported this week  Google  Apple and Facebook are moving aggressively into Hollywood s turf  preparing to spend billions to create original programming  as Amazon did before them 
These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks  In July  Netflix said that it had achieved a larger than expected increase in subscribers  who now total 104 million  and that it was reaching about half of United States households 
 Anyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long  hard fight and have very deep pockets   said Mr  Olson at Piper Jaffray   They have the money to spend on content  and they already have huge direct to consumer user bases and traffic  
Netflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney s popular children s offerings and Disney  and Pixar branded films  Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights  but analyst estimates range from about  220 million to  300 million a year 
As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor  it posed no threat to Disney  and offered a revenue source to complement Disney s cable channels and movies  Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012  But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming   especially in the coveted children s market long dominated by Disney 
Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr  Seuss s  Green Eggs and Ham   with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer  It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children s programming 
Netflix is competing with Disney on other fronts  too  Netflix said two weeks ago that Shonda Rhimes  the prolific television producer who created hits like  Grey s Anatomy  and  Scandal   would move to Netflix after 15 years at Disney s ABC Studios 
 Disney served its purpose   Mr  Olson said  Now  Netflix  has reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn t really need Disney anymore  
The question remains  Does Disney need Netflix  Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue  betting that it can build its own direct to consumer model  capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline 
And it s hedging its bet  For now  Disney s Marvel and  Star Wars  programming remains on Netflix  The most common criticism I heard wasn t that Disney was trying to create its own direct to consumer model  but that it had waited too long 
Still  nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off  it s Disney   and only a few others 
 After Disney  the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously   Mr  Olson said 
 Disney makes a lot of amazing content  and no one can replicate it   said Doug Creutz  senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen   Company   But they re putting a significant revenue stream at risk  If they succeed  they ll capture all the revenue  but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle  And it may not succeed  Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing  
As Mr  Creutz put it in a research note  Disney s move is putting  a very settled and successful part of the business model  at risk and  more aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita  
Mr  Olson agreed   If anyone can do it from a content perspective  it s probably them  because of their unique brand awareness   he said   But they re coming from way behind  
Investors didn t like the uncertainty  or the prospect of a full fledged war between Disney and Netflix  Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about  102 a share  down from  110 at the beginning of August  Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch  falling from  182 at the beginning of the month to  167 this week 
But Kevin A  Mayer  Disney s head of corporate strategy and business development  told me that his company s move wasn t a Disney vs  Netflix issue  but just the first step in a long term growth strategy for Disney   We can both do really well   he said   There s no zero sum game here  
Although it may seem a paradox  Mr  Mayer says he believes Disney s move into direct to consumer distribution   not to mention the tech world s rush into original programming   demonstrates that  content is everything these days  
Unlike the old world of cable and broadcast   the barriers to entry for an over the top provider are pretty low   he said  meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet   All the consumer is buying is content  not the apparatus to deliver it  Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand  We re already good at both    Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column  
In short  from Disney s perspective  Mr  Mayer said   content is more king than ever  
SAN FRANCISCO   Want to get rich quick through Bitcoins or other virtual currencies  You ll have to do it without Facebook 
The social network said Tuesday that it would ban all ads for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  in order to stop promotions that it sees as  frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices  
Under Facebook s new policy  no ads from well known digital currency exchanges or for initial coin offerings will be allowed  Among those who will be affected is James Altucher  a self described  crypto genius  whose viral ads have become a talking point in how the cryptocurrency boom has led to scams and wild price fluctuations 
Facebook s move followed questions about whether it has done enough to protect its site from bad actors  The company has been trying to clamp down on misinformation and false news after admitting last year that Russian agents had used it to spread divisive and polarizing messages 
The world of cryptocurrencies  which people have flooded into as prices soared in recent months  has also increasingly raised fears that parts of the market are dogged by scams  The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that it had halted what may have been a fraudulent initial coin offering that asked people to fund what was supposed to be the world s first  decentralized bank  
Rob Leathern  a Facebook product management director  announced the ban on cryptocurrency ads in a blog post  He said the ban was intentionally broad  as Facebook seeks to  better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices  
Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  has recently expressed an interest in digital currencies  In a Facebook post this month  he wrote that he was studying how to introduce cryptocurrency to his company  adding that he thought it would  take power from centralized systems and put it back into people s hands  
Cambridge Analytica  the political data firm with ties to President Trump s 2016 campaign  suspended its chief executive  Alexander Nix  on Tuesday  amid the furor over the access it gained to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users 
The decision came after a television broadcast in which Mr  Nix was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections 
The suspension represented a new low point for the fortunes of Cambridge Analytica and for Mr  Nix  who spent much of the past year making bold claims about the role his outfit played in the election of Mr  Trump  The company  founded by Stephen K  Bannon and Robert Mercer  a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least  15 million into it  offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior 
So called psychographic modeling techniques  which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook  underpinned Cambridge Analytica s work for the Trump campaign in 2016  Mr  Nix once called the practice  our secret sauce   though some have questioned its effectiveness 
But in recent days  the firm has found itself under increased scrutiny from lawmakers  regulators and prosecutors in the United States and Britain following reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the Facebook data  and that it still had a copy of the information 
The reports quickly put Mr  Nix in the cross hairs of a parliamentary committee investigating fake news and Russian interference in Britain s referendum to exit the European Union  Earlier this month  he told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had never obtained or used Facebook data   a statement that the firm itself has contradicted in recent days 
But it was Monday s broadcast by Channel 4 News in Britain that appeared to push the board of Cambridge Analytica to move against Mr  Nix  Channel 4 spent months investigating the company  and sent a reporter to pose as a prospective client from Sri Lanka  secretly filming the encounters with Mr  Nix 
The most damning footage was captured in January when Mr  Nix  sitting in a hotel bar in London  suggested the firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter  or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe 
 We have a long history of working behind the scenes   Mr  Nix said 
Inside Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Nix  the scion of a wealthy family who attended Eton College  the exclusive secondary school  had a reputation for lashing out at staff members  and for aggressively pursuing deals 
Christopher Wylie  a data expert who worked at the firm in 2013 and 2014 and helped develop its voter profiling technology  said in a recent interview that he kept memberships at a number of exclusive strip clubs near Pall Mall in London at the insistence of Mr  Nix  who often entertained clients from African and Caribbean countries there 
 Why would I have these memberships   said Mr  Wylie  who is gay   I didn t want them  
Channel 4 followed up Tuesday with a second part of its investigation that focused mainly on Mr  Nix s claims that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in the election of Mr  Trump   a claim that many inside the Trump campaign have disputed 
The Channel 4 report also included allegations first reported by The Times this past weekend that Cambridge Analytica s use of foreigners to work on election campaigns in the United States could have violated American election laws   The Times did not work with Channel 4  
Announcing its chief executive s suspension  Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that  in the view of the board  Mr  Nix s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation  
The company said it had asked Alexander Tayler  its chief data officer  to serve as its acting chief executive  Mr  Tayler trained as a chemical engineer and joined Cambridge Analytica in 2014 as its lead data scientist  according to his LinkedIn profile 
At the same time  the company said it was initiating an  independent investigation  of Mr  Nix s comments and the allegations facing the firm 
The company said it had hired a lawyer  Julian Malins   to lead this investigation  the findings of which the board will share publicly in due course  
It added   The board will be monitoring the situation closely  working closely with Dr  Tayler  to ensure that Cambridge Analytica  in all of its operations  represents the firm s values and delivers the highest quality service to its clients  
It was not immediately clear what impact Mr  Nix s resignation would have on the SCL Group  the parent company of Cambridge Analytica  The companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure  and their operations are deeply intertwined 
Mr  Nix  for instance  holds dual appointments at the two companies  Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family  but it is effectively a shell   it holds intellectual property rights to its psychographic modeling tools  yet its clients are served by the staff at London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  who is a British citizen 
Neither the Mercer family nor Mr  Bannon has publicly commented since the reports in the Times and The Observer 
Facebook  too  has sought to avoid the spotlight but also found itself under a similarly unwelcome glare  In the United States  the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy 
In addition  Eric T  Schneiderman  the attorney general of New York  said the state was joining Massachusetts in an investigation into whether the company failed to protect the privacy of users in those states  Their attorneys general have demanded that Facebook hand over information about its interactions with Cambridge Analytica 
 Consumers have a right to know how their information is used   and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users  personal information   Mr  Schneiderman said 
In Britain  Damian Collins  the chairman of the Digital  Culture  Media and Sport Select Committee of the House of Commons  which is running the inquiry into fake news  called on Mark Zuckerberg  Facebook s chief executive  to give evidence to Parliament 
In a letter  Mr  Collins said that previous answers from Facebook officials about the misuse of data had been  misleading  
 It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process   the letter said  adding   I hope that this representative will be you

 After this story was published  Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain  Read the latest  
LONDON   As the upstart voter profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections  it had a problem 
The firm had secured a  15 million investment from Robert Mercer  the wealthy Republican donor  and wooed his political adviser  Stephen K  Bannon  with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior  But it did not have the data to make its new products work 
So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission  according to former Cambridge employees  associates and documents  making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network s history  The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate  developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump s campaign in 2016 
An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm   and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics   under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic 
Christopher Wylie  who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014  said of its leaders   Rules don t matter for them  For them  this is a war  and it s all fair  
 They want to fight a culture war in America   he added   Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war  
Details of Cambridge s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign  setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm s so called psychographic modeling techniques 
But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed   and Facebook  until now  has not acknowledged it  Interviews with a half dozen former employees and contractors  and a review of the firm s emails and documents  have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove 
Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who  Facebook says  claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes 
During a week of inquiries from The Times  Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control  But on Friday  the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action 
 This was a scam   and a fraud   Paul Grewal  a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network  said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday  He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica  Mr  Wylie and the researcher  Aleksandr Kogan  a Russian American academic  from Facebook   We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all   and take action against all offending parties   Mr  Grewal said 
Alexander Nix  the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica  and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data  most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month  But in a statement to The Times  the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data  though it blamed Mr  Kogan for violating Facebook s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago 
In Britain  Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the  Brexit  campaign  The country has strict privacy laws  and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was  illegally acquired and used  
In the United States  Mr  Mercer s daughter  Rebekah  a board member  Mr  Bannon and Mr  Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns  according to company documents and former employees 
Congressional investigators have questioned Mr  Nix about the company s role in the Trump campaign  And the Justice Department s special counsel  Robert S  Mueller III  has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election 
While the substance of Mr  Mueller s interest is a closely guarded secret  documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine  And the WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange  disclosed in October that Mr  Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr  Trump s Democratic opponent  Hillary Clinton 
The documents also raise new questions about Facebook  which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news  The data Cambridge collected from profiles  a portion of which was viewed by The Times  included details on users  identities  friend networks and  likes   Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party 
 Protecting people s information is at the heart of everything we do   Mr  Grewal said   No systems were infiltrated  and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked  
Still  he added   it s a serious abuse of our rules  
The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr  Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013  Mr  Wylie recalled in an interview  They had much to celebrate 
Mr  Nix  a brash salesman  led the small elections division at SCL Group  a political and defense contractor  He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data  recruiting Mr  Wylie  then a 24 year old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama s campaigns  Mr  Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters  behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists  some of them affiliated with Cambridge University 
The group experimented abroad  including in the Caribbean and Africa  where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government held data  former employees said 
Then a chance meeting brought Mr  Nix into contact with Mr  Bannon  the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser  and with Mr  Mercer  one of the richest men on earth 
Mr  Nix and his colleagues courted Mr  Mercer  who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics  and his daughter Rebekah  who shared his conservative views  Mr  Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America s culture and rewire its politics  recalled Mr  Wylie and other former employees  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements  Mr  Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment 
Mr  Mercer agreed to help finance a  1 5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia s gubernatorial race in November 2013  where the Republican attorney general  Ken Cuccinelli  ran against Terry McAuliffe  the Democratic fund raiser  Though Mr  Cuccinelli lost  Mr  Mercer committed to moving forward 
The Mercers wanted results quickly  and more business beckoned  In early 2014  the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  work that Mr  Nix was eager to win 
When Mr  Wylie s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr  Neugebauer  Mr  Nix castigated them over email 
 ITS 2 PAGES   4 hours work max  or an hour each   What have you all been doing    he wrote 
Mr  Wylie s team had a bigger problem  Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense  Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior 
But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was  say  a neurotic introvert  a religious extrovert  a fair minded liberal or a fan of the occult  Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages 
Mr  Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University s Psychometrics Centre  Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook  The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app  which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends  activity that Facebook permitted at the time  The approach  the scientists said  could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew   a claim that has been disputed 
When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm  Mr  Wylie found someone who would  Dr  Kogan  who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques  Dr  Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica  The business covered the costs   more than  800 000   and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research  according to company emails and financial records 
All he divulged to Facebook  and to users in fine print  was that he was collecting information for academic purposes  the social network said  It did not verify his claim  Dr  Kogan declined to provide details of what happened  citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica  though he maintained that his program was  a very standard vanilla Facebook app  
He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm  Mr  Wylie said  a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague  Of those  roughly 30 million   a number previously reported by The Intercept   contained enough information  including places of residence  that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles  Only about 270 000 users   those who participated in the survey   had consented to having their data harvested 
Mr  Wylie said the Facebook data was  the saving grace  that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers 
 We wanted as much as we could get   he acknowledged   Where it came from  who said we could have it   we weren t really asking  
Mr  Nix tells a different story  Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month  he described Dr  Kogan s contributions as  fruitless  
Just as Dr  Kogan s efforts were getting underway  Mr  Mercer agreed to invest  15 million in a joint venture with SCL s elections division  The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure  forming a new American company  owned almost entirely by Mr  Mercer  with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr  Wylie s team  according to company documents  Mr  Bannon  who became a board member and investor  chose the name  Cambridge Analytica 
The firm was effectively a shell  According to the documents and former employees  any contracts won by Cambridge  originally incorporated in Delaware  would be serviced by London based SCL and overseen by Mr  Nix  a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL  Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian  like Mr  Wylie  or European 
But in July 2014  an American election lawyer advising the company  Laurence Levy  warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections 
In a memo to Mr  Bannon  Ms  Mercer and Mr  Nix  the lawyer  then at the firm Bracewell   Giuliani  warned that Mr  Nix would have to recuse himself  from substantive management  of any clients involved in United States elections  The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders  Mr  Levy wrote   to manage the work and decision making functions  relative to campaign messaging and expenditures  
In summer and fall 2014  Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections  mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country  Few Americans were involved in the work  which included polling  focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC  conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis  the North Carolina Republican 
Cambridge Analytica  in its statement to The Times  said that all  personnel in strategic roles were U S  nationals or green card holders   Mr  Nix  never had any strategic or operational role  in an American election campaign  the company said 
Whether the company s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees  roles in each campaign  and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules 
Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle  when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr  Cruz and then Mr  Trump  While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year  most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries  according to two former employees 
Under the guidance of Brad Parscale  Mr  Trump s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re election effort  Cambridge performed a variety of services  former campaign officials said  That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund raising appeals  modeling voter turnout  buying  5 million in television ads and determining where Mr  Trump should travel to best drum up support 
Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign  Mr  Nix has said that the firm s profiles helped shape Mr  Trump s strategy   statements disputed by other campaign officials   but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters 
In a BBC interview last December  Mr  Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on  legacy psychographics  built for the Cruz campaign 
By early 2015  Mr  Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company  Most were liberal leaning  and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard right candidates the Mercer family favored 
Cambridge Analytica  in its statement  said that Mr  Wylie had left to start a rival firm  and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims  It characterized Mr  Wylie and other former  contractors  as engaging in  what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company  
Near the end of that year  a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign  sending Facebook scrambling  In a statement at the time  Facebook promised that it was  carefully investigating this situation  and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it 
Facebook verified the leak and   without publicly acknowledging it   sought to secure the information  efforts that continued as recently as August 2016  That month  lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors   This data was obtained and used without permission   said a letter that was obtained by the Times   It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately  
Mr  Grewal  the Facebook deputy general counsel  said in a statement that both Dr  Kogan and  SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question  
But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook s control  The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained 
While Mr  Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data  a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers  and that the files were not encrypted 
Today  as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas  Mr  Nix has mentioned some questionable practices  This January  in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times  he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world  and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations 
All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica s political business  No American campaigns or  super PACs  have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms  and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr  Trump s re election campaign 
In the meantime  Mr  Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market  He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age   a  Math Man   he puts it  In the United States last year  a former employee said  Cambridge pitched Mercedes Benz  MetLife and the brewer AB InBev  but has not signed them on 
Facebook said Wednesday that it had taken down several pages associated with  Britain First   a far right group whose leaders were recently convicted of hate crimes and whose inflammatory anti Muslim videos President Trump shared with the world late last year 
The social network said that the pages of Britain First and its leaders  Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen  had repeatedly violated community standards with posts that boasted of Islamophobia  incited hateful anti Muslim comments and compared Muslim immigrants to animals 
After the administrators of the pages failed to heed a final warning to abide by Facebook s standards  the company took the fringe group s pages down 
 We do not do this lightly  but they have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups  which disqualifies the Pages from our service   Facebook said 
The Britain First Facebook page had about two million followers around the world 
Facebook said that while it remains an open platform for all ideas and political speech  a wide range of views can and should be expressed  without needing to denigrate others on the basis of who they are  
Britain First  a Christian nationalist group estimated to have about 1 000 members  has used inflammatory tactics like confronting Muslims on the street and entering mosques to spread its belief that Islam is destroying Britain 
In November  it got an unexpected boost from President Trump  who helped to promote its message by sharing with his tens of millions of Twitter followers three videos Ms  Fransen  the deputy leader  had posted on her own account 
One video was titled  Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches   but featured an assailant who was not  in fact  a  Muslim migrant   The other two  titled  Muslim destroys a statue of Virgin Mary   and  Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and beats him to death   were several years old and included no context 
Before Mr  Trump retweeted those videos  no modern American president had amplified inflammatory content of that nature from an extremist organization 
Mr  Golding  Britain First s leader  and Ms  Fransen were both convicted last week on counts of religiously aggravated harassment stemming from videos they posted online  Mr  Golding was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison while Ms  Fransen was sentenced to 36 weeks 
The videos  from May  showed Ms  Fransen knocking on doors that she believed   incorrectly  according to prosecutors   were hiding the Muslim defendants in a rape trial  She insulted the men and challenged them to come out 
Facebook and other social networks have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid rising concern about the proliferation of hate speech and conspiracy theories online 
Facebook made waves in the media industry with its recent announcement that it would put a new focus on  meaningful social interactions  with close friends and family in its News Feed   the column that people scroll through when they open the site   instead of content from publishers and brands 
The company  which together with Google dominates the online advertising industry  has emphasized to ad agencies that the shift will mostly affect the visibility of publishers that have been able to reach readers for free through News Feed s automated placement of their posts  It won t  the company said  affect the sponsored posts that businesses pay to show people as they scroll 
But several advertising executives have speculated that the new rules could ultimately fuel the social network s long held video ambitions 
As advertisers examine the details that Facebook has shared so far  like reducing videos from publishers in the feed and giving priority to content that can  spark conversation   some see an opening for the company s nascent Facebook Watch video section and its live videos  And  of course  for the ad dollars that accompany such content 
 Facebook has been studying TV for a few years now  and they see there is a certain equation to the size and success of TV   said Ben Winkler  the chief investment officer of the agency OMD   It s three elements  a high quality user experience  prominent high quality video and a curated  restricted supply of said video  What that equation results in is higher rates and stable  consistent ad dollars and growth   and Facebook is looking for ad growth  
While Facebook said that it wanted people to spend less time  passively  viewing content  including videos  it also extolled the robust discussions that often accompany live video streams  And last week it said it was testing a product  called Watch Party  that will allow groups to watch non live videos together 
More generally  video content is  among the most shared and commented upon content on the web   said Mr  Winkler  who expects videos will now be given priority over text posts on Facebook 
Facebook is changing its site after a year in which the company came under governmental scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech  Separately  the company said on Friday that it would highlight high quality news on the site by allowing people to rank news sources that they saw as the most credible and trustworthy 
 There is a recognition that Facebook has been  for lack of a better word  toxic   said Brian Wieser  an analyst at Pivotal Research   If they have ideas around what the solution to that problem is  and it happens to clear the field for Facebook owned and  operated content  that s a happy coincidence  
Facebook makes most of its money from online ads   posting a net profit of  10 2 billion in 2016   and has made it clear that it believes its future lies in video and video ads  Wall Street analysts regularly ask the company about its progress in attracting the hefty ad budgets that remain locked up in television despite cord cutting and the emergence of streaming platforms 
Still  Facebook s video tab  Watch  which was introduced in August  has been met with some skepticism 
 One of the things that Facebook has done here that it hasn t necessarily done so much in the past is they let the ad model lead the consumer behavior versus the other way around   said Sarah Hofstetter  the chief executive of the agency 360i   Watch was built with the premise that ad dollars were coming to video and it would be smart for Facebook to have a video platform  
Ms  Hofstetter noted that Watch could potentially benefit if publishers that had relied heavily on Facebook traffic started making fewer videos now   This  in turn   she said   could lead to less inventory and push advertisers towards the more premium videos within Facebook Watch  
Publishers could also respond by migrating their videos to Watch  where Facebook could sell more of the pre roll ads with sound that run before YouTube videos  said Ben Hovaness  executive director of digital activation at Omnicom s Hearts   Science agency 
 You can think of the Watch tab as Facebook trying to have its own YouTube inside of it   he added 
Right now  said Mike Dossett  who leads digital strategy at the agency RPA  most Facebook video ads  show up as a sponsored video from a brand like any other post in your feed  
Mr  Dossett said he anticipated a broader transformation of what appeared on Facebook as the company focused on videos that inspired the active participation of its users  like live sports 
 It s interesting to see what that might turn into for the type of content Facebook is buying   he said   It s going to pretty radically shift the type of video that is populating the platform
